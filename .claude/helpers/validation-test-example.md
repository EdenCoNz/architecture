## Manual Validation Analysis

### Dimension 1: Title Complexity

**Detection**:
- Conjunctions: "and" (1 occurrence) = +3 points
- Verbs: "Create" (1), "Implement" (2) = 1 excess verb = +4 points
- Scope keywords: None = 0 points
- Character count: 67 characters (< 80) = 0 points
- Word count: 8 words (< 12) = 0 points
- Clauses: 1 clause = 0 points

**Title Complexity Score**: 3 + 4 = **7 points**

**Classification**: FAIL (6+)

**Feedback**:
```
[FAIL] Title Complexity: Score 7/6+
Issues:
- Contains "and" joining 2 distinct actions
- Contains 2 action verbs: "Create" and "Implement"
→ Suggestion: Split into separate stories:
  1. "Create User Registration Form"
  2. "Implement Email Verification"
```

---

### Dimension 2: Acceptance Criteria Complexity

**Detection**:
- Criteria count: 5 criteria (> 4) = (5 - 4) × 3 = +3 points
- Multi-concern criteria: None detected = 0 points
- Implementation-heavy: Criterion 3 is 8 words (< 20), no issue = 0 points
- Cross-concern: None detected = 0 points

**Criteria Complexity Score**: **3 points**

**Classification**: WARNING (3-5)

**Feedback**:
```
[WARNING] Acceptance Criteria: 5 criteria detected (limit: 4)
→ Suggestion: Split story by criteria groupings:
  - Registration form (criteria 1-2)
  - Email verification (criteria 3-5)
```

---

### Dimension 3: File Impact Estimation

**Detection**:
- CRUD operations: "Create" (registration) = 1 operation × 2.5 = 2.5 files
- Components: "form" mentioned = 1 component × 2.5 = 2.5 files
- Infrastructure: None = 0 files
- Multi-layer: "form" (frontend) + "send verification email" (backend) = 1.5x multiplier
- Database: User registration implies database = +3 files
- API endpoints: Registration endpoint = 1 × 2 = 2 files
- Documentation: None mentioned = 0 files

**Calculation**:
```
base = 2.5 + 2.5 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 10 files
with_multiplier = 10 × 1.5 = 15 files
```

**File Impact Score**: **6 points** (13+ files = FAIL)

**Classification**: FAIL (13+ files)

**Feedback**:
```
[FAIL] Estimated File Impact: ~15 files
→ Suggestion: Split story by:
  - Layer (separate frontend form from backend verification logic)
  - Concern (registration vs. email verification)
```

---

### Dimension 4: Time Estimation

**Detection**:
- Base time: 15 files × 0.25 = 3.75 days
- Complexity multiplier: Standard development = 1.0x
- Technology factors: "validation" mentioned = +0.5 days

**Calculation**:
```
estimated_days = (3.75 × 1.0) + 0.5 = 4.25 days
```

**Time Score**: **6 points** (> 3 days = FAIL)

**Classification**: FAIL (3+ days)

**Feedback**:
```
[FAIL] Estimated Time: ~4.25 days
→ Suggestion: Story too large. Split into smaller stories of 1-2 days each
```

---

### Dimension 5: Technology-Agnostic Compliance

**Detection**:
- Framework mentions: 0
- Library mentions: 0
- File extensions: 0
- Tool mentions: 0
- Pattern mentions: 0
- Language mentions: 0

**Technology Reference Score**: **0 points**

**Classification**: PASS (fully technology-agnostic)

**Feedback**: No technology violations detected ✅

---

## Composite Atomicity Score

### Calculation:
```
atomicity_score = 7 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 0 = 22 points

weighted_score = 100 - (22 × 3) = 100 - 66 = 34/100
```

### Classification: **MUST SPLIT** ❌ (Score: 34/100)

## Validation Summary

**Original Story Status:**
- ❌ MUST SPLIT (34/100)
- Multiple critical issues across title, criteria, scope, and time
- Technology compliance maintained

**Recommended Actions:**
1. ❌ CRITICAL: Split into 3 atomic stories as outlined above

## Test Result: PASS ✅

The validation system correctly:
1. Detected compound title with "and" and multiple verbs
2. Identified excessive acceptance criteria (5 > 4)
3. Estimated high file count (~15 files) based on multi-layer work
4. Estimated long implementation time (~4.25 days)
5. Confirmed technology-agnostic compliance
6. Calculated accurate composite score (34/100)
7. Classified as MUST_SPLIT appropriately
8. Provided clear, actionable splitting guidance
9. Showed expected score improvement after split (34 → 80 average)

This validation test confirms the design is sound and the integration will work as expected.
