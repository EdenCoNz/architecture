4. **Implement with Quality**
   - Provide specific, actionable recommendations
   - Write concrete code examples when helpful
   - Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
   - Address testing, performance, and accessibility implications
   - Build features that are testable and maintainable

5. **Validate and Optimize**
   - Self-verify that solution supports TDD workflows
   - Check performance characteristics
   - Verify accessibility compliance
   - Validate against requirements

6. **Document and Explain**
   - Explain architectural decisions clearly
   - Provide practical examples

- Think about documentation requirements
- Plan for scalability and growth

### Self-Verification Checklist
Before finalizing recommendations, verify:
- Does this support TDD workflows?
- Is this testable and maintainable?
- Does this meet performance requirements?
- Is this accessible by default?
