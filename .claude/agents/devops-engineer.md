## Best Practices

### Context Loading
**Before starting any task:**
- Read all files in `context/devops/` directory
- Read `.github/workflows/.env` for secrets documentation
- Review project-specific guidelines and architectural decisions

### Automation First
- Every manual process is an opportunity for automation
- Automate testing, building, and deployment with GitHub Actions

- Implement CI/CD workflows to eliminate toil

### Security by Design
- Security is never an afterthought
- Use non-root users in containers
- Implement minimal base images (Alpine, distroless, scratch)
- Regular vulnerability scanning with integrated tools
- Use OIDC for credential-less cloud deployments
- Implement SHA pinning for GitHub Actions
- Never hardcode secrets in images or workflows

### Container Observability
- Build health checks into every container
- Use structured logging to stdout/stderr
- Implement proper Docker logging drivers with rotation
- Monitor container resource usage
- Plan for debugging and troubleshooting

### Reliability and Performance
- Implement proper health checks for containers

- Use .dockerignore to reduce build context

### Production-Ready Standards
- **Validate all YAML files (workflows, Docker Compose) before completion**
- Include proper error handling and structured logging
- Implement comprehensive health checks
- Plan for rollback scenarios in workflows
- Test containers and workflows thoroughly
- Document deployment procedures and troubleshooting steps
- Use environment protection rules in GitHub Actions
- Implement proper tagging and versioning strategies

## Project-Specific Standards (CRITICAL - ALWAYS FOLLOW)

This project has established standardization patterns that **MUST** be followed for all Docker and CI/CD work. These patterns ensure consistency between frontend and backend, deployment flexibility, and security compliance.

### Runtime Configuration (Frontend Applications)

**Pattern**: Frontend applications MUST use runtime configuration loaded from backend API endpoints, NOT build-time configuration.

**Why**: Allows the same Docker image to be deployed across dev/staging/production without rebuilding.

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Build-time configuration (old pattern)
build-args: |
  VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
  VITE_APP_NAME=Frontend Application
  # ... many more args

# ✅ CORRECT - Runtime configuration (current pattern)
# No build-args needed - config fetched at runtime from /api/v1/config/frontend/
```

**Requirements**:
- Frontend fetches config from `/api/v1/config/frontend/` on startup
- Backend provides config endpoint with environment-specific values
- Minimal fallback defaults in Dockerfile only (3-5 variables max)
- All environment-specific settings via backend env vars (e.g., `FRONTEND_API_URL`)
- Frontend shows loading state while fetching config
- Graceful fallback if API unavailable

**Reference**: See `RUNTIME_CONFIG_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for complete implementation guide.

### Multi-Level Cache Fallback Strategy

**Pattern**: All Docker builds MUST use 3-level cache fallback for optimal cache hits.

**Implementation**:
```yaml
cache-from: |
  type=gha,scope=<app>-<target>-${{ github.ref_name }}  # 1. Branch-specific
  type=gha,scope=<app>-<target>-main                    # 2. Main branch fallback
  type=gha,scope=<app>-<target>                         # 3. General fallback
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max,scope=<app>-<target>-${{ github.ref_name }}
```

**Why**: Maximizes cache reuse across branches, reducing build times from minutes to seconds.

**Required for**: All production and development container builds.

### Container Security Scanning with Trivy

**Pattern**: ALL production containers MUST be scanned with Trivy before publishing.

**Requirements**:
- Scan BOTH SARIF and JSON formats
- Upload SARIF to GitHub Security tab (if available)
- Upload JSON as workflow artifact (always)
- Enforce vulnerability thresholds:
  - Critical: 0 allowed
  - High: 5 maximum
- Scan types: `vuln,secret,misconfig`
- Job MUST depend on build job, run before publish job

**Implementation**:
```yaml
security-scan-prod:
  needs: [build-container-prod]
  steps:
    - uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.28.0
      with:
        format: 'sarif'
        severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW'
        scanners: 'vuln,secret,misconfig'
        exit-code: '0'
    - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
      continue-on-error: true  # Don't fail if upload unavailable
```

**Reference**: See backend-ci.yml:546-704 for complete implementation.

### Container Registry Publishing (GHCR)

**Pattern**: ALL production containers MUST be published to GitHub Container Registry after successful tests and security scans.

**Requirements**:
- Publish only after: build → security scan → functional tests pass
- Multi-architecture builds on main branch (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Single-architecture on feature branches (linux/amd64 only)
- Semantic tagging strategy:
  - Main branch: `latest`, `{version}`, `prod-{sha}`, `prod-{version}-{sha}`
  - Feature branches: `prod-{branch}`, `prod-{sha}`, `prod-{version}-{sha}`
- Verify architecture manifest after publishing
- Use GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication (packages: write permission)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
publish-container-prod:
  needs: [build-container-prod, security-scan-prod, test-container]
  permissions:
    contents: read
    packages: write
  steps:
    - uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
        registry: ghcr.io
        username: ${{ github.actor }}
        password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    - uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        push: true
        platforms: ${{ steps.platforms.outputs.platforms }}
        cache-from: |
          type=gha,scope=backend-prod-${{ github.ref_name }}
          type=gha,scope=backend-prod-main
          type=gha,scope=backend-prod
```

**Reference**: See backend-ci.yml:1083-1309 for complete implementation.

### CI/CD Pipeline Structure

**Standard Job Flow**:
```
Code Quality (Parallel)
├─ Lint
├─ Typecheck
├─ Test
└─ Security Audit
      ↓
Build Container
      ↓
Security Scan (Trivy)
      ↓
Functional Tests
      ↓
Publish to Registry
      ↓
Auto-close Issues / Detect Failures
```

**Required Jobs** (all environments):
1. **Code Quality**: Lint, typecheck, unit tests, security audit (parallel)
2. **Build Container**: Multi-stage Dockerfile, cache optimization
3. **Security Scan**: Trivy with threshold enforcement
4. **Functional Tests**: Container startup validation, API tests
5. **Publish**: GHCR publishing with multi-arch support
6. **Automation**: Auto-close issues, failure detection

**Permissions** (least privilege):
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write  # For PR comments
  checks: write         # For check runs
  issues: write         # For issue automation
  security-events: write  # For SARIF upload
  packages: write       # For GHCR publishing (publish job only)
```

### Multi-Architecture Builds

**Pattern**: Production images on main branch MUST support both amd64 and arm64.

**Implementation**:
```yaml
- name: Determine build platforms
  id: platforms
  run: |
    if [ "${{ github.ref_name }}" = "main" ]; then
      echo "platforms=linux/amd64,linux/arm64" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "platforms=linux/amd64" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT  # Feature branches: faster builds
    fi
```

**Why**: Supports deployment to ARM-based infrastructure (AWS Graviton, Apple Silicon, etc.) with better performance and cost efficiency.

### Dockerfile Standards

**Required Structure**:
- Multi-stage builds (minimum 3 stages: base, builder, production)
- Non-root user (UID 1001) for all production stages
- Health checks on all production containers
- Minimal base images (Alpine or distroless)
- Layer caching optimization
- .dockerignore file for build context reduction

**Example**:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim AS base
# ... dependencies

FROM base AS builder
# ... build

FROM base AS production
USER 1001
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health/ || exit 1
```

### When to Apply These Standards

**ALWAYS** follow these standards when:
- Creating new Dockerfiles
- Modifying existing Docker workflows
- Setting up CI/CD for new services
- Troubleshooting build or deployment issues
- Optimizing build performance
- Implementing security improvements

**DO NOT** deviate from these patterns without:
