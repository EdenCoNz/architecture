# Docker Best Practices for Web Applications (2024-2025)

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide for implementing modern Docker practices in production web applications

## Summary

Docker practices have matured significantly in 2024-2025, with BuildKit as the default builder (since Docker Engine 23.0), rootless mode graduating from experimental status, and a strong emphasis on security-first approaches. Key trends include 87% of production containers containing at least one major vulnerability (2024 Cloud Native Security Report), 64% of developers using non-local cloud-based development environments (up from 36% in 2024), and Docker Hardened Images achieving a 95% reduction in attack surface (validated October 2025). The modern approach prioritizes minimal images, multi-stage builds, comprehensive vulnerability scanning, and strict non-root execution policies.

## Key Facts

**Build System Evolution:**
- BuildKit is the default builder in Docker Engine 23.0+ with intelligent layer caching and parallel execution
- Multi-stage builds can reduce image sizes by 70%+ and rebuild times from 10+ minutes to 30 seconds
- Cache mount usage (`--mount=type=cache`) provides persistent package caches across builds
- zstd compression is significantly faster than gzip with better compression ratios

**Security Standards:**
- Docker Hardened Images (validated October 2025) are rootless by default, signed, and include SBOM + VEX
- Rootless mode graduated from experimental in Docker Engine v20.10
- 87% of production container images have at least one major vulnerability requiring scanning tools
- Non-root user execution is now considered mandatory for production deployments

**Image Optimization:**
- Alpine, distroless, or scratch base images are preferred for minimal attack surface
- Multi-stage builds separate build dependencies from runtime artifacts
- BuildKit cache modes: "min" for final layers only, "max" for all intermediate layers
- Layer ordering: expensive/stable steps first, frequently changing steps last

**Compose Evolution:**
- The `version:` field in docker-compose.yml is obsolete in 2024
- Modern Compose files start directly with `services:` block
- Docker Compose designed for single-host development, not production orchestration
- Multi-file overlay pattern (`-f`) enables environment-specific configurations

## Analysis

### 1. 2024-2025 Best Practices

**Core Principles:**
Modern Docker practice emphasizes three pillars: security (non-root execution, minimal images, vulnerability scanning), efficiency (BuildKit with cache optimization, multi-stage builds), and observability (health checks, structured logging). The industry has moved away from "latest" tags, root users, and bloated images toward explicit versioning, least-privilege execution, and purpose-built containers.

**BuildKit Integration:**
BuildKit's intelligent caching and parallel execution have become standard. Enable it with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` or rely on Docker Engine 23.0+ defaults. BuildKit processes layers more intelligently, skipping unchanged steps and enabling concurrent stage execution in multi-stage builds.

**Image Selection:**
Use Docker Official Images, Verified Publisher images, or Docker-Sponsored Open Source images as base. Pin versions with SHA256 digests for reproducibility: `FROM node:20.10.0@sha256:abc123...`. Avoid general-purpose distributions (Ubuntu, Debian) for production; prefer Alpine (small footprint), distroless (no shell, minimal utilities), or scratch (empty base for static binaries).

### 2. Multi-stage Builds

**Optimal Patterns:**

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --only=production

# Development stage (optional)
FROM builder AS development
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]

# Production stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
COPY . .
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 1001
USER nodejs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Stage aliasing: Use `FROM base-image AS common-name` to reference shared dependencies
- Conditional branching: Use build arguments to select different stages based on environment
- Parallel execution: BuildKit automatically parallelizes independent stages
- Shared base stages: Create reusable stages with common dependencies to reduce duplication

### 3. Security Hardening

**Rootless Containers:**
Rootless mode runs the Docker daemon and containers inside a user namespace without requiring root privileges during installation or runtime. Prerequisites include `newuidmap`/`newgidmap` utilities and at least 65,536 subordinate UIDs/GIDs in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`.

Implementation:
```bash
# Install rootless Docker
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install

# Set environment variables
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/docker.sock

# Verify
docker info  # Should show "rootless" context
```

**Non-root User in Containers:**
Even without rootless mode, containers should never run as root:

```dockerfile
# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S appuser && \
    adduser -S appuser -u 1001

# Set ownership
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser
```

**Vulnerability Scanning:**
Integrate scanning into CI/CD pipelines with these tools:

- **Trivy**: Fast, comprehensive, open-source scanner for OS packages, dependencies, and IaC files. Best for quick local scanning and CI/CD integration.
- **Grype**: Focused on package vulnerabilities with exceptional accuracy and SBOM-first approach. Efficient incremental database updates.
- **Snyk**: Commercial platform with AI-enhanced remediation advice, rich dashboards, and developer-focused workflows.

```bash
# Trivy example
docker run aquasec/trivy image myapp:latest

# Grype example
grype myapp:latest

# Docker Scout (native)
docker scout cves myapp:latest
```

**Additional Hardening:**
- Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities: `docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE`
- Use read-only root filesystem: `docker run --read-only --tmpfs /tmp`
- Apply security profiles: Seccomp, AppArmor, or SELinux
- Never hardcode secrets; use Docker secrets, environment variables, or external secret managers
- Scan base images regularly; rebuild frequently to incorporate security patches

### 4. Performance Optimization

**Image Size Reduction:**
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude build context files (`.git`, `node_modules`, test files)
- Combine RUN commands to reduce layers: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y pkg && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`
- Clean package manager caches in the same layer: `RUN npm ci && npm cache clean --force`
- Remove build tools from production images via multi-stage builds

**Layer Caching Strategy:**
Order Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing:

```dockerfile
# 1. Base image (rarely changes)
FROM node:20-alpine

# 2. System dependencies (rarely change)
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++

# 3. Application dependencies (change occasionally)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# 4. Application code (changes frequently)
COPY . .
```

**BuildKit Cache Mounts:**
Persistent caches across builds dramatically improve performance:

```dockerfile
# Package manager cache
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --only=production

# Apt cache
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/var/lib/apt \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y pkg

# Go module cache
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod \
    go build -o app
```

**Remote Caching:**
Share cache across CI/CD environments:

```bash
# Build with inline cache
docker buildx build --cache-to=type=inline --tag myapp:latest .

# Build with registry cache
docker buildx build \
  --cache-from=type=registry,ref=myregistry/myapp:cache \
  --cache-to=type=registry,ref=myregistry/myapp:cache,mode=max \
  --tag myapp:latest \
  .
```

### 5. Development vs Production

**Multi-file Compose Strategy:**

Base configuration (`compose.yaml`):
```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
```

Production overrides (`compose.production.yaml`):
```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: myregistry/myapp:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

Development overrides (`compose.override.yaml`):
```yaml
services:
  web:
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    command: npm run dev
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Development (uses compose.yaml + compose.override.yaml automatically)
docker compose up

# Production
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml up -d
```

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Development | Production |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Base images | Full-featured (node:20) | Minimal (node:20-alpine) |
| Volumes | Bind mounts for live code | Named volumes for persistence only |
| Ports | Host binding (3000:3000) | Reverse proxy/load balancer |
| Logging | stdout | Aggregation service (ELK, Loki) |
| Restart policy | no | always/unless-stopped |
| Build tools | Included | Excluded via multi-stage |
| Hot reload | Enabled | Disabled |
| Debugging tools | Included | Excluded |

### 6. Orchestration

**Docker Compose for Development:**
Docker Compose excels for local development on single hosts with features like:
- Declarative service definition with dependency management
- Automatic network creation and DNS resolution between services
- Volume management for persistent data and bind mounts
- Environment variable configuration
- Service scaling: `docker compose up --scale web=3`

**Compose Limitations for Production:**
Docker Compose was primarily designed for local development and lacks critical production features:
- No native high availability or automatic failover
- No built-in load balancing across multiple hosts
- Limited health-based routing and self-healing
- No rolling update strategies
- Single-host constraint (no cluster orchestration)
- No sophisticated secrets management

**Production Orchestration Options:**
- **Docker Swarm**: Docker-native orchestration for simpler use cases, built-in load balancing, rolling updates, secrets management. Good for small to medium deployments.
- **Kubernetes**: Industry-standard orchestration for complex, large-scale deployments. Extensive ecosystem, advanced scheduling, comprehensive service mesh integration.
- **Managed Services**: AWS ECS/Fargate, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Instances reduce operational overhead.

**When to Use Compose in Production:**
Docker Compose is acceptable for production in limited scenarios:
- Single server deployments with moderate traffic
- Internal tools or staging environments
- Applications without high-availability requirements
- Small teams without orchestration expertise

Use with strict configuration: restart policies (`restart: always`), resource limits, health checks, log aggregation, and proper monitoring.

### 7. Networking & Storage

**Networking Best Practices:**

**Bridge Networks (Default):**
```bash
# Create custom bridge network
docker network create --driver bridge myapp-network

# Connect containers
docker run --network=myapp-network --name web myapp:latest
docker run --network=myapp-network --name db postgres:16
```

Containers on the same bridge network can communicate via service name DNS resolution.

**Host vs Bridge:**
- Bridge: Isolated network, port mapping required, better security
- Host: Container uses host network stack, no isolation, better performance for high-throughput scenarios

**Storage Best Practices:**

**Named Volumes (Preferred):**
```bash
# Create named volume
docker volume create myapp-data

# Use in container
docker run -v myapp-data:/app/data myapp:latest
```

Benefits: Docker-managed, portable, can be backed up, support drivers for cloud storage.

**Bind Mounts (Development Only):**
```bash
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path myapp:latest
```

Use cases: Live code reloading in development, accessing host configuration files. Avoid in production due to tight host coupling.

**tmpfs Mounts (Temporary Data):**
```bash
docker run --tmpfs /tmp:rw,size=100m,mode=1777 myapp:latest
```

Use for sensitive temporary data, caching, or performance-critical writes that don't need persistence.

**Volume Security:**
- Use read-only volumes where possible: `-v data:/app/data:ro`
- Implement volume encryption for sensitive data
- Regular backup strategies: `docker run --rm -v myapp-data:/data -v /backup:/backup ubuntu tar czf /backup/data.tar.gz /data`

### 8. Health Checks & Monitoring

**Health Check Implementation:**

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=40s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
```

**Compose Health Checks:**
```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: myapp:latest
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

**Health Endpoint Design:**
Implement comprehensive `/health` endpoints that check:
- Application responsiveness
- Database connectivity
- Cache availability
- Downstream service dependencies
- Disk space and resource availability

Return appropriate HTTP status codes: 200 (healthy), 503 (unhealthy).

**Logging Strategies:**

**Structured Logging:**
Output JSON-formatted logs to stdout/stderr for easy parsing:
```javascript
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  level: 'info',
  message: 'Request processed',
  requestId: '123',
  duration: 45
}));
```

**Log Aggregation:**
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana for log storage, processing, and visualization
- **Loki + Grafana**: Lightweight alternative, label-based indexing
- **Cloud Solutions**: AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor

**Docker Logging Drivers:**
```yaml
services:
  web:
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

Options: `json-file`, `syslog`, `journald`, `fluentd`, `awslogs`, `gcplogs`

**Monitoring Tools (2024-2025):**
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Industry-standard metrics collection and visualization
- **cAdvisor**: Container-specific metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk)
- **Docker Stats API**: Built-in resource usage monitoring
- **Commercial Solutions**: Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace, Lumigo for comprehensive observability

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- Container resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network)
- Health check status and failure rates
- Container restart counts
- Image pull times and failures
- Application-specific metrics exposed via /metrics endpoints

### 9. CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions with Docker (2024-2025 Pattern):**

```yaml
name: Docker CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}

      - name: Extract metadata
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
        with:
          images: myregistry/myapp
          tags: |
            type=ref,event=branch
            type=sha,prefix={{branch}}-

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
          cache-from: type=registry,ref=myregistry/myapp:cache
          cache-to: type=registry,ref=myregistry/myapp:cache,mode=max

      - name: Scan image with Trivy
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: myregistry/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
          format: 'sarif'
          output: 'trivy-results.sarif'

      - name: Upload scan results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use official Docker actions (setup-buildx-action, build-push-action, login-action)
- Store credentials as GitHub secrets, prefer API tokens over passwords
- Implement vulnerability scanning before deployment
- Use BuildKit cache (registry or GitHub cache) for faster builds
- Tag images with semantic versions and git SHA for traceability
- Separate build/test jobs from deployment for better pipeline control

**Multi-platform Builds:**
```yaml
- name: Build multi-platform image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
    push: true
    tags: myregistry/myapp:latest
```

**Deployment Strategies:**
- Blue-green deployments with tagged images
- Canary releases using traffic splitting
- Rolling updates with health check validation
- Automated rollback on health check failures

### 10. Common Pitfalls

**Critical Anti-patterns to Avoid:**

**1. Running as Root:**
```dockerfile
# BAD - runs as root by default
FROM node:20
COPY . /app
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

# GOOD - explicit non-root user
FROM node:20-alpine
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && adduser -S nodejs -u 1001
COPY --chown=nodejs:nodejs . /app
USER nodejs
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

**2. Using Latest Tags:**
```dockerfile
# BAD - unpredictable, changes without notice
FROM node:latest

# GOOD - pinned with digest for reproducibility
FROM node:20.10.0-alpine@sha256:abc123def456...
```

**3. Hardcoded Secrets:**
```dockerfile
# BAD - secrets in image layers
ENV API_KEY="secret-key-123"
RUN echo "password" > /app/credentials

# GOOD - runtime secrets
# Use Docker secrets, env vars from orchestrator, or external secret managers
```

**4. Installing Unnecessary Packages:**
```dockerfile
# BAD - bloated image with build tools in production
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git curl wget vim build-essential python3

# GOOD - minimal production image
FROM node:20-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates
```

**5. Not Using .dockerignore:**
```
# .dockerignore - always include
node_modules
.git
.env
*.log
coverage/
.vscode/
README.md
```

**6. Single-stage Builds with Build Tools:**
```dockerfile
# BAD - build tools in production image
FROM node:20
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]

# GOOD - multi-stage excludes build tools
FROM node:20 AS builder
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

**7. No Resource Limits:**
```yaml
# BAD - can consume all host resources
services:
  web:
    image: myapp

# GOOD - defined resource constraints
services:
  web:
    image: myapp
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1'
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 256M
```

**8. Missing Health Checks:**
```yaml
# BAD - no health monitoring
services:
  web:
    image: myapp

# GOOD - health checks for reliability
services:
  web:
    image: myapp
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
```

**9. Building on Production Servers:**
Never build images on production servers. Build in CI/CD pipelines and deploy pre-built, tested images. Building affects application performance and introduces security/reproducibility risks.

**10. Sharing Dev and Prod Images:**
Development images contain test frameworks, debuggers, hot-reload tools, and source maps. Production images should contain only runtime dependencies. Use multi-stage builds with environment-specific targets.

**11. Ignoring Log Management:**
Without log rotation, containers can fill disk space. Always configure log limits:
```yaml
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"
    max-file: "3"
```

**12. Not Scanning for Vulnerabilities:**
87% of production containers have at least one major vulnerability. Integrate scanning into CI/CD:
```bash
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL myapp:latest
```

Fail builds on high-severity vulnerabilities.

## Action Items

1. **Audit existing Dockerfiles**: Review all Dockerfiles for root users, latest tags, hardcoded secrets, and unnecessary packages. Convert to multi-stage builds with explicit non-root users and pinned base image versions.

2. **Implement vulnerability scanning**: Integrate Trivy, Grype, or Snyk into CI/CD pipelines. Set up automated daily scans of deployed images and establish policies for addressing HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities within 7 days.

3. **Enable BuildKit and cache optimization**: Ensure `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` is set. Add cache mounts to Dockerfiles for package managers. Configure registry cache in CI/CD for 3-5x faster builds.

4. **Establish environment-specific Compose files**: Create `compose.yaml` (base), `compose.override.yaml` (development), and `compose.production.yaml` (production) with appropriate configurations for each environment.

5. **Implement health checks**: Add `HEALTHCHECK` instructions to all application Dockerfiles and corresponding endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`) that verify dependencies. Configure orchestration to use these checks for routing and restarts.

6. **Set up structured logging and monitoring**: Implement JSON-formatted logging to stdout/stderr. Deploy log aggregation (ELK, Loki) and metrics collection (Prometheus + Grafana). Monitor container resource usage, restart counts, and health check failures.

7. **Configure resource limits**: Add CPU and memory limits to all production containers in Compose files or orchestration configs. Start with conservative limits and adjust based on actual usage metrics.

8. **Migrate to rootless mode or non-root users**: Evaluate rootless Docker daemon for development environments. Ensure all production containers run with explicit non-root users (UID 1001+). Test with read-only root filesystems where possible.

9. **Create .dockerignore files**: Add `.dockerignore` to all projects excluding `.git`, `node_modules`, test files, and development configurations to reduce build context size by 50-90%.

10. **Document CI/CD pipeline**: Create or update CI/CD workflows using official Docker actions, implement multi-stage vulnerability scanning, and establish deployment procedures with rollback capabilities. Set up automated rebuilds for base image updates.

## Caveats

This research reflects best practices as of October 2025. Docker and container ecosystems evolve rapidly; verify tool versions and features before implementation. Rootless mode has known limitations (networking restrictions, performance considerations) that may not suit all use cases. Docker Compose production suitability depends heavily on scale and availability requirements - what works for small deployments may fail at enterprise scale. Vulnerability scanning tools have varying accuracy and false-positive rates; always validate critical findings. Performance optimization techniques (especially caching strategies) require testing in your specific environment as results vary based on infrastructure, network speed, and application characteristics. The 87% vulnerability statistic reflects images without active scanning/patching programs; well-maintained images have significantly lower risk.
