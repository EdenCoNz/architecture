## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for theme mode storage
- **Theme System**: MUI createTheme with custom palettes
- **Provider Pattern**: ThemeProvider wraps entire application
- **Context API**: ThemeContext for component access
- **Memoization**: Theme object memoized for performance

### Component Structure
```
App
├── Provider (Redux)
│   └── ThemeContextProvider
│       └── AppThemeProvider (MUI)
│           ├── Header (with ThemeToggle)
│           └── Routes
│               ├── Home
│               ├── TestPage
│               └── NotFound
```

### Theme Toggle Flow
1. User clicks ThemeToggle button
2. Redux action dispatched (toggleTheme)
3. Theme mode updated in store
4. ThemeContext re-renders with new mode
5. MUI theme recreated with new palette
6. All components re-render with new theme
7. CSS transitions applied (225ms)
