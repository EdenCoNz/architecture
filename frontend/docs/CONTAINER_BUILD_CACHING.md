# Container Build Layer Caching

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced Docker build layer caching strategy implemented in the CI/CD pipeline to minimize rebuild times and optimize pipeline performance.

## Cache Strategy

### Multi-Source Cache Hierarchy

The build uses a sophisticated multi-source cache strategy that provides multiple fallback options for maximum cache hit rates:

#### Development Container Caching

```yaml
cache-from:
  - type=gha,scope=frontend-dev-${{ github.ref_name }}  # Branch-specific (primary)
  - type=gha,scope=frontend-dev-main                    # Main branch (fallback 1)
  - type=gha,scope=frontend-dev                         # General dev (fallback 2)

cache-to:
  - type=gha,mode=max,scope=frontend-dev-${{ github.ref_name }}
  - type=gha,mode=max,scope=frontend-dev
```

#### Production Container Caching

```yaml
cache-from:
  - type=gha,scope=frontend-prod-${{ github.ref_name }}  # Branch-specific (primary)
  - type=gha,scope=frontend-prod-main                     # Main branch (fallback 1)
  - type=gha,scope=frontend-prod                          # General prod (fallback 2)
  - type=gha,scope=frontend-base                          # Base stage (fallback 3)

cache-to:
  - type=gha,mode=max,scope=frontend-prod-${{ github.ref_name }}
  - type=gha,mode=max,scope=frontend-prod
  - type=gha,mode=max,scope=frontend-base
```

### How It Works

1. **Primary Cache (Branch-Specific)**: Each branch maintains its own cache for optimal reuse of layers specific to that branch's work
2. **Fallback Cache (Main Branch)**: When branch cache is unavailable, falls back to main branch cache which contains stable, tested base layers
3. **General Cache**: Shared cache across all branches for common layers (node_modules, base image, etc.)
4. **Base Stage Cache**: (Production only) Shared cache for the base stage that both dev and prod builds use

### Cache Mode: max

Using `mode=max` exports all layers including intermediate build stages:
- Maximizes cache reuse across builds
- Includes both final and intermediate layers
- Slightly larger cache storage but significantly faster rebuilds

## Dockerfile Layer Optimization

The Dockerfile is already optimized for caching with these best practices:

### 1. Separate Dependency Installation from Code Copy

```dockerfile
# Good: Dependencies installed first (changes infrequently)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci

# Code copied later (changes frequently)
COPY . .
```

**Why**: Package files change less frequently than source code. By installing dependencies first, that layer is cached and reused even when source code changes.

### 2. Use BuildKit Cache Mounts

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci
```

**Why**: BuildKit cache mounts persist the npm cache across builds, speeding up `npm ci` even when package.json changes.

### 3. Multi-Stage Build Structure

```
base → development
base → builder → production
```

**Why**: Shared base stage is cached once and reused by both development and production builds.

### 4. .dockerignore File

The `.dockerignore` file excludes unnecessary files from the build context:
- Reduces build context size
- Prevents cache invalidation from irrelevant file changes
- Speeds up context transfer to BuildKit

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Build Times

| Build Type | First Build (Cold Cache) | Subsequent Build (Cached) | Cache Hit Rate |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Development | 2-3 minutes | 30-60 seconds | ~80-90% |
| Production | 3-5 minutes | 1-2 minutes | ~70-85% |

### Cache Effectiveness Indicators

The build output includes performance metrics:

```markdown
### Build Performance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Build Time | 1m 23s |
| Cache Strategy | Multi-source (branch + main + general) |
| Cache Mode | max (all layers) |
| Branch Cache | frontend-dev-feature/9-caching |
```

**Interpreting Build Times**:
- **< 1 min**: Excellent cache hit rate (90%+)
- **1-2 min**: Good cache hit rate (70-90%)
- **2-3 min**: Moderate cache hit rate (50-70%)
- **> 3 min**: Cold build or major dependency changes

## Cache Management

### Automatic Cleanup

GitHub Actions automatically manages cache cleanup:

1. **7-Day Eviction**: Caches not accessed in 7 days are automatically removed
2. **10 GB Limit**: Repository-wide cache limit with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
3. **Branch Deletion**: Caches are automatically removed when branches are deleted

### Cache Scopes

| Scope Pattern | Purpose | Lifetime |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| `frontend-dev-<branch>` | Branch-specific dev builds | Until branch deleted or 7 days unused |
| `frontend-prod-<branch>` | Branch-specific prod builds | Until branch deleted or 7 days unused |
| `frontend-dev-main` | Main branch dev baseline | Persists (frequently accessed) |
| `frontend-prod-main` | Main branch prod baseline | Persists (frequently accessed) |
| `frontend-dev` | General dev cache | LRU eviction |
| `frontend-prod` | General prod cache | LRU eviction |
| `frontend-base` | Base stage shared cache | LRU eviction |

### Manual Cache Cleanup

If needed, you can manually delete caches using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# List all caches
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/caches

# Delete a specific cache by ID
gh api --method DELETE repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/caches/{cache_id}

# Delete caches for a specific branch
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/caches \
  --jq '.actions_caches[] | select(.key | contains("feature/xyz")) | .id' \
  | xargs -I {} gh api --method DELETE repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/caches/{}
```

## Optimizing for Parallel Builds

The cache strategy is designed to work correctly with parallel builds:

1. **Scope Isolation**: Each build writes to its own branch-specific scope
2. **Read-Only Fallbacks**: Fallback caches are read-only (from other branches)
3. **Concurrent Writes**: GitHub Actions handles concurrent cache writes safely
4. **No Lock Contention**: Multiple builds can read from shared caches simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Builds Despite Caching

**Symptoms**: Builds take 3+ minutes consistently

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Frequent Dependency Changes**: package.json/package-lock.json changing frequently
   - **Solution**: Stabilize dependencies, use exact versions
2. **Large Build Context**: Too many files being sent to BuildKit
   - **Solution**: Review and update `.dockerignore`
3. **Cache Eviction**: Cache limit reached, caches being evicted
   - **Solution**: Check cache usage in cleanup job output

### Cache Misses on Minor Changes

**Symptoms**: Small code changes trigger full rebuilds

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Build Context Changes**: Files copied before dependencies
   - **Solution**: Review Dockerfile layer order
2. **Timestamp Changes**: File timestamps changing without content changes
   - **Solution**: Ensure clean git checkout in CI

### Inconsistent Build Times

**Symptoms**: Build times vary wildly between runs

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Parallel Builds**: Multiple builds on different branches competing for cache
   - **Expected**: Branch-specific caches will stabilize over time
2. **Cache Warming**: First build on new branch is always slower
   - **Expected**: Subsequent builds will use branch cache

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Stable Dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary dependency updates in feature branches
2. **Small Commits**: Smaller changes = more cache reuse
3. **Local Testing**: Test Docker builds locally before pushing
4. **Clean Builds**: Occasionally run clean builds to verify no cache-dependent bugs

### For CI/CD Maintenance

1. **Monitor Build Times**: Track build time trends to identify cache issues
2. **Review Cache Usage**: Check cleanup job output periodically
3. **Update Base Images**: Update base images (node:20-alpine) monthly for security
4. **Preserve Main Cache**: Main branch caches are critical fallbacks, protect them

## BuildKit Configuration

### Increased Cache Storage

```yaml
buildkitd-flags: --oci-worker-gc-keepstorage=10000
```

**Why**: Increases BuildKit's internal cache storage from default 5GB to 10GB, improving cache retention for parallel builds.

### Disabled Provenance and SBOM

```yaml
provenance: false
sbom: false
```

**Why**: Reduces build overhead and image size. Enable these in production deployments for supply chain security.

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Cache Mount for Build Dependencies

Already implemented in Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci
```

### 2. Layer Ordering by Change Frequency

Current order (least to most frequently changing):
1. Base image
2. Package files
3. Dependencies install
4. Source code
5. Build command

### 3. Conditional Layer Rebuilding

Development builds skip production-specific layers:
- Health checks
- Security headers
- Build optimizations

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Track these metrics over time:

1. **Average Build Time**: Should trend downward as caches populate
2. **Cache Hit Rate**: Estimated from build times (< 1 min = high hit rate)
3. **Cache Storage Usage**: Monitored in cleanup job
4. **Failed Builds Due to Cache**: Should be zero (cache failures should fall back)

### GitHub Actions Metrics

The workflow reports these metrics in GitHub Step Summary:

- **Build Duration**: Actual time spent building
- **Cache Strategy**: Which caches were used
- **Image Size**: Final image size for optimization tracking
- **Expected vs Actual**: Comparison to expected performance
