# Logging Guidelines & Standards

**Version**: 1.3
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: Architecture Team

---

## Purpose

These guidelines define what to log, what to omit, and how to structure implementation logs for optimal value-to-noise ratio. They help all specialized agents understand when and how to document their work, ensuring implementation logs provide maximum value without overwhelming detail or unnecessary noise.

---

## Three-Tier Logging Level Framework

The logging framework categorizes all actions into three distinct levels based on their importance to understanding what was accomplished during implementation. This framework enables fast, consistent logging decisions that prioritize outcomes over processes.

### Overview

| Level | Purpose | When to Use | Signal-to-Noise Ratio |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Essential** | Actions that fundamentally change the system | Always log these actions | High Signal |
| **Contextual** | Actions that provide meaningful context for understanding decisions | Log when they add significant value | Medium Signal |
| **Optional** | Routine actions that rarely add value | Generally skip unless exceptional | Low Signal / Noise |

---

## Quick Reference Logging Checklist

**Use this checklist before starting implementation or when uncertain about logging decisions.**

### The 10 Essential Questions

1. **Did I CREATE, MODIFY, or DELETE a file?** → ✅ **ESSENTIAL** - Always log file changes

2. **Did I change CONFIGURATION or ENVIRONMENT settings?** → ✅ **ESSENTIAL** - Always log config changes

3. **Did I DISCOVER something unexpected that changed my approach?** → ✅ **CONTEXTUAL** - Log the discovery and decision

4. **Did I INVESTIGATE and find the ROOT CAUSE of an issue?** → ✅ **CONTEXTUAL** - Log findings and solution

5. **Did I just READ files I created or am working on?** → ❌ **OPTIONAL** - Skip routine reads

6. **Did I SEARCH and find nothing significant?** → ❌ **OPTIONAL** - Skip exploratory searches without findings

7. **Did validation/tests PASS as expected?** → ❌ **OPTIONAL** - Skip routine successful validations

8. **Is this the 3rd+ time doing the SAME action?** → ❌ **OPTIONAL** - Skip repetitive actions, summarize if needed

9. **Am I logging WHAT was built (outcome)?** → ✅ **GOOD** - Focus on outcomes

10. **Am I logging HOW I built it (process)?** → ❌ **BAD** - Skip process details unless debugging complex issues

### The 3-Second Decision Rule

**Ask**: Did I **CHANGE** something → Essential | Did I **DISCOVER** something → Contextual | Is this **ROUTINE** → Optional/Skip

### The Ultimate Memory Aid

**ALWAYS Log**: File changes, Configuration changes, Dependency updates, Database schema, Deployment actions, Bug fixes

**SOMETIMES Log**: Discoveries that changed approach, Root cause investigations, Failed approaches that informed solution, Complex debugging patterns

**NEVER Log**: Reading files, Searching code, Checking status, Navigation, Routine validation passes, Individual steps in multi-step processes

---

## Level 1: Essential Logging

**Definition**: Actions that fundamentally change the system state, configuration, or capabilities. These actions must always be logged because they represent irreversible or significant changes that directly impact the system's behavior or structure.

### Classification Criteria

An action qualifies as **Essential** if it meets at least one of these criteria:

1. **State-Changing Operations**
   - Creates, modifies, or deletes files in the codebase
   - Changes system configuration or environment settings
   - Modifies database schema or data structures
   - Updates dependencies or package versions
   - Alters deployment configurations or infrastructure

2. **Critical Decision Points**
   - Architecture decisions that affect system design
   - Technology selection or framework choices
   - API contract changes or breaking modifications
   - Security-related changes or fixes
   - Performance optimization decisions

3. **External Actions**
   - Git operations (commits, merges, pushes)
   - Deployment actions or releases
   - External API integrations or changes
   - CI/CD pipeline modifications
   - Third-party service configurations

4. **Error Resolution**
   - Fixes that resolve bugs or failures
   - Workarounds for critical issues
   - Rollback operations
   - Recovery from failed operations

### Fast Recognition Test

Ask yourself: **"If someone reviews this implementation log without access to the code, would they need to know about this action to understand what changed in the system?"**

- If **YES** → Log it as Essential
- If **MAYBE** → It's likely Contextual (see next section)
- If **NO** → It's likely Optional (skip it)

### Detailed Essential Criteria with Examples

The following examples provide concrete guidance on recognizing Essential actions and understanding why they must always be logged.

#### Example 1: File Creation (Always Essential)

**Rule**: Every new file created in the codebase MUST be logged.

**Why Essential**: File creation represents a fundamental expansion of the system's capabilities. Someone reviewing the implementation must know what new files exist to understand the full scope of changes.

**What to Log**:
- Full file path (absolute from project root)
- Brief description of file purpose
- Key functionality it provides

**Example Log Entry**:
```
Created: /backend/api/views/user_profile.py
Purpose: Implements UserProfileViewSet with CRUD operations for user profile management
Key endpoints: GET/PUT /api/users/{id}/profile
```

**Counter-Example (NOT Essential - Don't Log)**:
```
Read: /backend/api/views/user_profile.py to verify the file was created correctly
```
**Why NOT Essential**: Reading a file you just created is routine verification, not a system change.

---

#### Example 2: File Modification (Always Essential)

**Rule**: Every modification to an existing file MUST be logged with clear description of what changed.

**Why Essential**: Modifications alter existing system behavior. Understanding what changed in which files is critical for tracking system evolution and debugging issues.

**What to Log**:
- Full file path
- Specific changes made (not line-by-line, but functional changes)
- Reason for the change

**Example Log Entry**:
```
Modified: /frontend/src/components/LoginForm.tsx
Changes: Added email validation before form submission; integrated with new AuthContext for centralized auth state
Reason: Fix issue #234 where invalid emails were being sent to backend
```

**Counter-Example (NOT Essential - Don't Log)**:
```
Read: /frontend/src/components/LoginForm.tsx to understand current implementation before making changes
```
**Why NOT Essential**: Reading before modifying is routine preparation, not a system change.

---

#### Example 3: File Deletion (Always Essential)

**Rule**: Every file deletion MUST be logged with clear rationale.

**Why Essential**: Deletions remove system capabilities. This is critical information for understanding what was removed and why, especially if functionality needs to be restored later.

**What to Log**:
- Full file path of deleted file
- What functionality was removed
- Why it was safe to delete (what replaced it, or why it's no longer needed)

**Example Log Entry**:
```
Deleted: /backend/services/legacy_payment_processor.py
Functionality Removed: Old PayPal integration (v1 API)
Rationale: Replaced by new unified payment service using PayPal v2 API in /backend/services/payment_gateway.py
```

**Counter-Example (NOT Essential - Don't Log)**:
```
Read: /backend/services/legacy_payment_processor.py to verify it's safe to delete
```
**Why NOT Essential**: Reading to validate deletion is routine due diligence, not the deletion itself.

---

#### Example 4: Configuration Changes (Always Essential)

**Rule**: Any change to configuration files, environment variables, or system settings MUST be logged.

**Why Essential**: Configuration changes alter system behavior without code changes. These are often the most critical actions to document because they affect runtime behavior and can cause production issues if not tracked.

**What to Log**:
- Configuration file or setting changed
- Specific parameters modified (old value → new value)
- Impact on system behavior
- Environment affected (local, staging, production, or all)

**Example Log Entry**:
```
Modified: /docker-compose.yml
Changes:
  - Updated API_TIMEOUT from 5000ms to 30000ms
  - Added new environment variable API_RETRY_COUNT=3
Impact: Prevents timeout failures for slow external API calls; adds automatic retry on failure
Environment: Production and staging configurations
```

**Counter-Example (NOT Essential - Don't Log)**:
```
Read: /docker-compose.yml to check current timeout value before modifying
```
**Why NOT Essential**: Reading config to inform your change is preparation, not the change itself.

---

#### Example 5: Dependency Changes (Always Essential)

**Rule**: Adding, removing, or updating package dependencies MUST be logged.

**Why Essential**: Dependencies are external code that become part of your system. Version changes can introduce breaking changes, security fixes, or new features. This must always be documented.

**What to Log**:
- Package name and version change (old → new, or "added" / "removed")
- Reason for the change
- Impact on system capabilities

**Example Log Entry**:
```
Modified: /frontend/package.json
Changes:
  - Added: axios@1.6.0 (HTTP client for API requests)
  - Updated: react@18.2.0 → react@18.3.1 (security patch for XSS vulnerability)
  - Removed: deprecated-library@2.1.0 (functionality replaced by native fetch API)
Impact: Improved API request handling, fixed security vulnerability CVE-2024-1234
```

**Counter-Example (NOT Essential - Don't Log)**:
```
Read: /frontend/package.json to check current dependency versions
```
**Why NOT Essential**: Reading package.json to understand dependencies is routine investigation.

---

#### Example 6: Database Schema Changes (Always Essential)

**Rule**: Any change to database schema (tables, columns, indexes, constraints) MUST be logged.

**Why Essential**: Schema changes are irreversible operations that fundamentally change data structure. These changes often require migrations and can break existing functionality if not properly tracked.

**What to Log**:
- Migration file created or schema change made
- Tables/columns affected
- Type of change (add, modify, delete)
- Data migration strategy if applicable

**Example Log Entry**:
```
Created: /backend/migrations/0023_add_user_preferences.py
Changes:
  - Added table: user_preferences (columns: user_id, theme, language, notifications_enabled)
  - Added foreign key: user_preferences.user_id → users.id
  - Created index on user_preferences.user_id for query performance
Migration Strategy: Creates table with nullable columns; no data migration needed
```

**Counter-Example (NOT Essential - Don't Log)**:
```
Read: /backend/models/user.py to understand current user model structure before designing new table
```
**Why NOT Essential**: Reading models to inform schema design is routine preparation.

---

#### Example 7: Deployment & Infrastructure Changes (Always Essential)

**Rule**: Any change to deployment configuration, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure code, or container orchestration MUST be logged.

**Why Essential**: These changes affect how the system is built, tested, and deployed. Deployment issues can cause production outages, so tracking these changes is critical for troubleshooting and rollback.

**What to Log**:
- Deployment/infrastructure file changed
- Specific changes made
- Impact on build/deploy/runtime behavior
- Environments affected

**Example Log Entry**:
```
Modified: /.github/workflows/deploy.yml
Changes:
  - Added automated database backup step before deployment
  - Increased deployment timeout from 10m to 20m for large migrations
  - Added Slack notification on deployment failure
Impact: Provides rollback safety and better visibility into deployment issues
Environments: Production deployments only (staging unchanged)
```

**Counter-Example (NOT Essential - Don't Log)**:
```
Read: /.github/workflows/deploy.yml to understand current pipeline structure before making changes
```
**Why NOT Essential**: Reading CI/CD config to inform changes is routine preparation.

---

### Essential Logging: Clear Rules Summary

Use these simple rules to instantly recognize Essential actions:

**ALWAYS Log These Actions (Essential)**:
- Creating any file in the codebase
- Modifying any file in the codebase
- Deleting any file in the codebase
- Changing configuration files or environment variables
- Adding, updating, or removing dependencies
- Modifying database schema or creating migrations
- Changing deployment, CI/CD, or infrastructure code
- Git operations (commits, merges, pushes)
- Implementing fixes for bugs or issues

**NEVER Log These Actions (Not Essential)**:
- Reading files (unless the read revealed critical unexpected information - then it's Contextual)
- Searching or grepping code (routine exploration - unless findings were significant, then it's Contextual)
- Checking status (git status, process status, etc.)
- Navigating directories or exploring project structure
- Running standard validation that passes as expected (unless validating a critical fix - then it's Contextual)

### Timing Consideration

Essential logging should capture:
- **What** changed (the outcome)
- **Why** it changed (the reason/context)
- **NOT** the detailed steps of how it changed (process details)

---

## Level 2: Contextual Logging

**Definition**: Actions that provide meaningful context for understanding decisions, problem-solving approaches, or system exploration, but do not directly change the system. These actions should be logged when they significantly contribute to understanding the implementation narrative.

**Key Principle**: Contextual logging bridges the gap between Essential actions (what changed) and the reasoning behind those changes. It answers "Why did you make that choice?" and "How did you identify the problem?"

### Classification Criteria

An action qualifies as **Contextual** if it meets at least one of these criteria:

1. **Significant Discovery Actions**
   - Complex searches that identify patterns or issues
   - Reading critical configuration files to understand system behavior
   - Analyzing error messages or logs to diagnose problems
   - Reviewing existing implementations before making changes
   - Exploring system architecture to inform design decisions

2. **Validation and Verification**
   - Running tests to verify fixes or features
   - Checking system state after critical changes
   - Validating assumptions before implementation
   - Confirming expected behavior

3. **Multi-Step Problem Solving**
   - Iterative debugging approaches (not every step, but the approach)
   - Alternative solutions considered before final choice
   - Failed attempts that informed the successful approach
   - Research that led to implementation decisions

4. **Important Patterns**
   - When the same action was repeated many times, log once with context (e.g., "Read 15 component files to understand the pattern")
   - When an exploratory action revealed an unexpected finding
   - When a read operation changed your implementation approach

### Detailed Decision Rules

Use these rules to determine if an action qualifies as Contextual:

#### Rule 1: The Discovery Rule
**Log if the action revealed information that changed your approach.**

- ✅ **YES**: "Searched for error handling patterns, discovered inconsistent approaches across 10 files"
- ❌ **NO**: "Searched for error handling, found the expected try-catch pattern"

#### Rule 2: The Influence Rule
**Log if the action directly influenced a subsequent Essential change.**

- ✅ **YES**: "Read authentication middleware to understand token validation flow before adding new endpoint"
- ❌ **NO**: "Read file I just modified to verify syntax"

#### Rule 3: The Non-Obvious Rule
**Log if someone reviewing the log would wonder "How did you know to do that?"**

- ✅ **YES**: "Analyzed API response logs, identified timeout pattern during peak hours"
- ❌ **NO**: "Read component props to understand how to use it"

#### Rule 4: The Validation Value Rule
**Log validation/testing when it validates a critical fix or demonstrates thoroughness for important changes.**

- ✅ **YES**: "Ran full test suite after database migration to verify no regressions (253 tests passed)"
- ❌ **NO**: "Ran tests after adding new function (3 tests passed as expected)"

#### Rule 5: The Pattern Recognition Rule
**Log when multiple actions revealed a pattern, but log the pattern once, not each action.**

- ✅ **YES**: "Reviewed 8 API endpoint implementations, identified common rate-limiting pattern"
- ❌ **NO**: Eight separate log entries for reading each endpoint file

### Fast Recognition Test

Ask yourself: **"Would knowing about this action help someone understand why I made specific implementation decisions?"**

- If **YES, significantly** → Log it as Contextual
- If **YES, but it's routine** → It's likely Optional (skip it)
- If **NO** → It's definitely Optional (skip it)

### When to Skip Contextual Actions

Skip logging even potentially contextual actions when:
- The action is routine and expected (e.g., reading a file you just modified to verify changes)
- Multiple similar actions occurred (log the pattern once, not each instance)
- The action didn't influence any decisions or outcomes
- The context is already obvious from Essential actions logged
- The action is standard practice for the type of work (e.g., reading files before editing them)
- The discovery was trivial or expected

### Guidance: Complex Searches

Complex searches can provide valuable context OR create noise. Use these guidelines:

#### When to Log Searches (Contextual):

1. **Search revealed patterns**: "Searched for database query patterns across 15 files, identified N+1 query problem in 5 locations"
2. **Search identified inconsistencies**: "Searched for error handling approaches, found 3 different patterns causing maintenance issues"
3. **Search informed architecture decision**: "Searched for state management patterns, confirmed Redux usage across all 20+ components"
4. **Search located a problem**: "Searched for memory leak patterns, identified unclosed subscriptions in 3 components"
5. **Search scope was significant**: "Searched entire codebase for security vulnerabilities, analyzed 50+ files for SQL injection risks"

#### When to Skip Searches (Optional):

1. **Exploratory search without findings**: "Searched for similar components, didn't find any"
2. **Routine code lookup**: "Searched for function definition to understand parameters"
3. **Standard file location search**: "Used glob to find test files"
4. **Multiple incremental searches**: Ten searches refining search terms without significant findings
5. **Search for expected information**: "Searched for import statement to find correct path"

#### Guidelines:
- **Summarize, don't enumerate**: Instead of logging each search, log the overall investigation
- **Focus on findings**: Log what you discovered, not just that you searched
- **Combine related searches**: Group multiple searches into one log entry describing the investigation
- **Skip routine searches**: File lookups and standard code navigation are noise

### Guidance: Multiple Sequential Validation Checks

When performing multiple validation checks, follow these patterns:

#### Pattern 1: Summarize Routine Validations (Skip Individual Checks)

**Scenario**: After making a change, you run multiple standard checks

**❌ Don't Log Each Check**:
```
1. Ran unit tests - passed
2. Ran integration tests - passed
3. Checked linting - passed
4. Checked TypeScript compilation - passed
5. Verified code formatting - passed
```

**✅ Do Summarize**:
```
Verified changes with standard validation suite (unit tests, integration tests, linting, TypeScript, formatting - all passed)
```

#### Pattern 2: Log Critical Validations Individually (Contextual)

**Scenario**: Validating a risky change or fix

**✅ Log When Validation is Critical**:
```
1. Ran database migration on test data (1000 records migrated successfully, no data loss)
2. Verified backward compatibility with existing API clients (tested 5 different client versions)
3. Load tested new endpoint (sustained 1000 req/s without performance degradation)
```

**When to log individual validations**:
- Validating a critical fix or risky change
- Each validation tests a different risk dimension
- Validation results provide evidence of thoroughness
- Validation discovered issues that required additional work

#### Pattern 3: Log First Validation, Skip Repeats (Skip After First)

**Scenario**: Iteratively fixing and testing

**❌ Don't Log Every Iteration**:
```
1. Fixed validation bug, ran tests - 2 failed
2. Fixed test failures, ran tests - 1 failed
3. Fixed remaining failure, ran tests - all passed
```

**✅ Do Log Outcome**:
```
Fixed validation bug and resolved test failures (3 tests updated to match new validation logic)
```

#### Pattern 4: Log Validation Pattern Discovery (Contextual)

**Scenario**: Validation revealed unexpected issues

**✅ Log When Discovery Adds Value**:
```
1. Ran full test suite, discovered 12 flaky tests in CI environment
2. Investigated flaky tests, identified race condition in shared test fixtures
3. Fixed race condition by adding proper cleanup between tests
4. Re-ran tests 5 times to verify stability (all passed consistently)
```

**When to log validation discoveries**:
- Validation revealed unexpected problems
- Multiple validation attempts identified a pattern
- Validation led to additional fixes beyond original scope

### Contextual Logging Examples

The following examples demonstrate Contextual logging in action, with explanations of why each action qualifies as Contextual rather than Essential or Optional.

#### Example 1: Reading Configuration to Inform Implementation

**Action**: Read `/backend/config/settings/production.py` to understand production environment configuration before implementing caching strategy

**Why Contextual (not Essential)**:
- Doesn't change the system (just a read operation)
- Provides critical context for why caching was implemented in a specific way
- Informed the decision about cache expiration times and storage backend
- Someone reviewing the log would understand "How did you know to use Redis with 1-hour TTL?"

**Why Contextual (not Optional)**:
- Not routine - this specific read directly influenced architecture decisions
- The information discovered was significant to the implementation approach
- Skip logging this and the log reader would wonder how decisions were made

**Log Entry Format**:
```
Read production settings to understand caching infrastructure constraints
Context: Identified Redis as available cache backend with 2GB memory limit, informed decision to implement LRU caching with 1-hour TTL
```

#### Example 2: Complex Search Revealing Pattern

**Action**: Searched for API error handling patterns across 20 endpoint files, discovered 3 different approaches being used inconsistently

**Why Contextual (not Essential)**:
- Search itself didn't change the system
- But it revealed important information about code quality issues
- Led to subsequent Essential actions (standardizing error handling)
- Provides context for why standardization was needed

**Why Contextual (not Optional)**:
- Search had significant findings (inconsistency problem)
- Result influenced subsequent implementation decisions
- Demonstrates due diligence and thoroughness

**Log Entry Format**:
```
Analyzed error handling patterns across 20 API endpoints
Context: Discovered 3 inconsistent approaches (try-catch in 8 files, error middleware in 7 files, mixed approach in 5 files), leading to decision to standardize on middleware pattern
```

#### Example 3: Validation After Critical Change

**Action**: Ran full test suite after modifying authentication middleware (253 tests, all passed)

**Why Contextual (not Essential)**:
- Running tests didn't change the system
- But validation was critical for a security-sensitive change
- Demonstrates thoroughness and due diligence
- Provides confidence that the change is safe

**Why Contextual (not Optional)**:
- Not routine validation - this was for a critical security component
- Results provide important evidence of quality
- Anyone reviewing would want to know this validation occurred

**Log Entry Format**:
```
Validated authentication middleware changes with full test suite
Context: All 253 tests passed including 15 security-specific tests, confirming no regressions in authentication flow
```

#### Example 4: Exploratory Reading That Changed Approach

**Action**: Read 5 different frontend component files to understand state management patterns before implementing new feature

**Why Contextual (not Essential)**:
- Reading files didn't change anything
- But the exploration informed a critical architecture decision
- Pattern discovered (Redux usage) influenced implementation approach
- Without this context, log reader wouldn't understand why Redux was chosen

**Why Contextual (not Optional)**:
- Not routine reading - this was deliberate architectural research
- Findings directly influenced subsequent implementation
- Demonstrates considered decision-making rather than arbitrary choices

**Log Entry Format**:
```
Reviewed state management patterns across 5 major components (Dashboard, Profile, Settings, Notifications, Reports)
Context: Confirmed consistent Redux usage with normalized state, informed decision to follow established pattern rather than introduce new state management approach
```

#### Example 5: Investigation Leading to Root Cause

**Action**: Analyzed application logs for 3 hours, identified memory leak pattern in subscription cleanup

**Why Contextual (not Essential)**:
- Log analysis didn't change the system
- But investigation identified the root cause of production issues
- Provides crucial context for subsequent fix
- Demonstrates problem-solving approach

**Why Contextual (not Optional)**:
- Investigation had significant findings (root cause identified)
- Hours of work that led to actionable insight
- Shows the problem wasn't obvious and required investigation

**Log Entry Format**:
```
Investigated memory leak in production by analyzing 3 days of application logs
Context: Identified pattern of unclosed WebSocket subscriptions in 3 components (Dashboard, Notifications, Chat), occurring when users navigate away without explicit disconnect
```

#### Example 6: Failed Approach That Informed Solution

**Action**: Attempted to fix performance issue using database indexing, but profiling showed application-level caching was needed instead

**Why Contextual (not Essential)**:
- Failed attempt didn't change the system (or was rolled back)
- But documents the reasoning path to the final solution
- Explains why caching was chosen over indexing
- Prevents future developers from trying the same failed approach

**Why Contextual (not Optional)**:
- Failed attempt provided valuable learning
- Explains non-obvious decision (why not indexing?)
- Shows that multiple approaches were considered

**Log Entry Format**:
```
Attempted database indexing optimization for slow queries (10s response time)
Context: Added indexes on user_id and created_at columns, but profiling showed only 15% improvement. Further analysis revealed application was making 50+ duplicate queries per request, leading to decision to implement application-level caching instead
```

#### Example 7: Pre-Implementation Validation Check

**Action**: Checked existing CI/CD pipeline configuration before adding new deployment stage to understand current workflow

**Why Contextual (not Essential)**:
- Reading configuration didn't change anything
- But understanding current workflow was critical to adding new stage correctly
- Prevents breaking existing deployments
- Informs placement and dependencies of new stage

**Why Contextual (not Optional)**:
- Not routine - deliberate due diligence before making changes
- Understanding gained directly influenced implementation
- Shows careful approach to infrastructure changes

**Log Entry Format**:
```
Reviewed existing CI/CD pipeline stages to understand deployment workflow
Context: Identified 3-stage pipeline (build, test, deploy to staging), determined new production deployment stage should be added after staging deployment with manual approval gate
```

### Comparison: Contextual vs Essential vs Optional

These scenarios illustrate the differences between logging levels:

| Scenario | Essential | Contextual | Optional |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Creating a new file** | ✅ "Created Button.tsx component" | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Reading file to understand pattern** | ❌ | ✅ "Reviewed 5 components to confirm Redux pattern" | ❌ (if routine) |
| **Reading file you just created** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Skip (verification noise) |
| **Search that found a problem** | ❌ | ✅ "Search revealed 3 inconsistent patterns" | ❌ |
| **Search that found nothing** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Skip (no findings) |
| **Running tests after critical fix** | ❌ | ✅ "Validated fix with 253 tests" | ❌ |
| **Running tests routinely** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Skip (routine validation) |
| **Investigation that found root cause** | ❌ | ✅ "Analyzed logs, found memory leak" | ❌ |
| **Reading files without learning anything new** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Skip (no discoveries) |
| **Failed approach that informed solution** | ❌ | ✅ "Tried indexing, chose caching" | ❌ |

**Key Insight**: Contextual actions don't change the system but provide the "why" behind Essential changes. They answer questions like:
- "How did you know to make that change?"
- "Why did you choose that approach?"
- "What led you to that decision?"
- "How did you discover the problem?"

---

## Level 3: Optional Logging

**Definition**: Routine actions that are part of normal workflow but rarely add value to understanding what was accomplished. These actions should generally be skipped unless they provide exceptional value in a specific context.

**Core Principle**: Optional actions are noise, not signal. They represent the routine mechanics of development work that are expected and unremarkable. Logging these actions clutters implementation logs without adding understanding of what changed or why.

### Classification Criteria

An action qualifies as **Optional** (skip logging) if it meets these characteristics:

1. **Routine Read Operations**
   - Reading files you just created or modified
   - Viewing files to understand code you're currently working on
   - Sequential reads during normal development flow
   - Reading documentation or comments in code
   - Re-reading files during iterative development
   - Checking file contents before/after modifications

2. **Exploratory Actions Without Findings**
   - Searches that didn't find anything significant
   - Reading files that didn't influence decisions
   - Checking status without taking action
   - Routine validation that passed as expected
   - Grep/search operations during code exploration
   - Failed searches that didn't lead anywhere

3. **Process Noise**
   - Individual steps in a multi-step operation (log the outcome instead)
   - Intermediate verification steps
   - Repeated similar actions (reading 10 files one by one)
   - Actions that are implicit in the work (e.g., opening an editor)
   - Navigating between related files
   - Switching between different parts of the codebase

4. **Tool Usage**
   - Standard IDE operations
   - Using grep/search repeatedly during exploration
   - Navigating directory structures
   - Viewing git history or status
   - Running linters or formatters
   - Checking syntax or type errors

5. **Routine Verification**
   - Checking if changes applied correctly (by reading the file you just edited)
   - Verifying syntax after writing code
   - Confirming expected file structure
   - Standard pre-commit checks
   - Routine test runs during development (vs. validation test runs)

### Fast Recognition Test

Ask yourself: **"Would anyone ever ask 'why didn't you log this action?'"**

- If **NO** → Skip it (it's Optional noise)
- If **YES** → Re-evaluate using Essential or Contextual criteria

### Detailed Examples: Why These Are Noise, Not Signal

Understanding **why** Optional actions should be skipped is crucial. Each example below demonstrates common actions that feel important while doing them but add no value to implementation logs.

#### Example 1: Reading Files You Just Modified

**Action**: After editing `UserService.ts`, read the file to verify changes.

**Why It's Noise**:
- Reading your own modifications is implicit in the editing process
- The fact that you edited the file (Essential) already implies you reviewed it
- This adds no information about what changed or why
- If someone reviews the log, they don't need to know you verified your own work

**What to Log Instead**:
- ✅ **Log**: "Updated UserService.ts to add password hashing with bcrypt" (Essential)
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Read UserService.ts to verify password hashing implementation"

---

#### Example 2: Sequential File Reads During Code Exploration

**Action**: Read 10 component files one-by-one to understand the project's component structure.

**Why It's Noise**:
- Each individual read adds no value; the pattern matters, not each file
- Listing all 10 files clutters the log without adding understanding
- The outcome of exploration matters, not the exploration process
- Readers care about what you learned, not which files you opened

**What to Log Instead**:
- ✅ **Log**: "Reviewed existing component patterns to inform new dashboard design" (Contextual - if it influenced decisions)
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Read Header.tsx", "Read Footer.tsx", "Read Sidebar.tsx", ... (10 separate entries)
- ✅ **Alternative**: Skip entirely if exploration didn't influence any decisions

**Key Insight**: This directly addresses the acceptance criterion: "Given I perform my tenth file read in a row, when I check the Optional criteria, then I should recognize these routine reads should not clutter the implementation log"

**Pattern Recognition**: If you're reading multiple similar files sequentially (3+), that's a strong signal these reads are Optional noise. Either summarize the exploration as one Contextual entry (if it led to insights), or skip logging entirely (if routine).

---

#### Example 3: Search Operations That Found Nothing

**Action**: Searched codebase for "authentication middleware" but found no existing implementation.

**Why It's Noise**:
- Negative results from routine searches add no value
- The absence of findings doesn't inform what you actually built
- Failed searches are expected parts of code exploration
- Only log searches that discovered something that changed your approach

**What to Log Instead**:
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Searched for 'authentication middleware' (no results)"
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Used grep to find authentication patterns - none found"
- ✅ **Only Log If**: Search revealed unexpected existing code that changed your implementation plan (then it's Contextual)

---

#### Example 4: Routine Validation That Passed

**Action**: Ran TypeScript compiler to check for type errors; no errors found.

**Why It's Noise**:
- Expected validation passing is not noteworthy
- Type checking is routine part of TypeScript development
- Only failures that required fixes are worth logging
- Success in routine checks is assumed, not exceptional

**What to Log Instead**:
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Ran TypeScript compiler - no errors"
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Checked TypeScript types - all valid"
- ✅ **Only Log If**: Type checking revealed errors that required code changes (then log the fix as Essential)

**Contrast with Contextual**: If you ran extensive validation on a critical change (e.g., "Validated database migration with 100K records"), that's Contextual. Routine daily validation is Optional.

---

#### Example 5: Checking Git Status

**Action**: Ran `git status` to see what files have been modified.

**Why It's Noise**:
- Git status checks are routine development workflow
- They don't change anything or reveal insights
- The actual git operations (commits, merges) are Essential, but status checks are not
- This is process noise without outcome value

**What to Log Instead**:
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Checked git status"
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Ran git status to see modified files"
- ✅ **Log**: "Committed changes to user authentication feature" (Essential)

---

#### Example 6: Reading Documentation or Package README

**Action**: Read the React Router documentation to understand route configuration syntax.

**Why It's Noise**:
- Reading documentation is expected when using any library
- The fact that you implemented routing correctly implies you understood the docs
- This adds no information about your implementation
- Only log documentation reading if it led to a surprising discovery or architectural decision

**What to Log Instead**:
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Read React Router documentation"
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Reviewed React Router docs to understand routing syntax"
- ✅ **Only Log If**: "Discovered React Router v6 has breaking changes requiring route refactoring" (Contextual - influenced approach)
- ✅ **Otherwise**: Just log the implementation: "Updated routing to use React Router v6 declarative routes in App.tsx" (Essential)

---

#### Example 7: Iterative File Reading During Development

**Action**: Open `api.ts`, modify it, read it again, modify it again, read it again (multiple cycles).

**Why It's Noise**:
- Iterative development cycles are completely normal
- Each individual read in the edit-read-edit cycle adds zero value
- Logs should capture the final outcome, not the iterations
- This is extreme process noise that clutters without informing

**What to Log Instead**:
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Read api.ts" (5 times during iterative development)
- ❌ **Don't Log**: "Read api.ts to review changes", "Read api.ts again to verify fix"
- ✅ **Log**: "Updated api.ts to add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests" (Essential - the outcome)

**Key Insight**: If you read the same file multiple times during implementation, that's a clear signal those reads are Optional noise. Log the final change, not the reading process.

---

### Exceptions: When to Elevate Optional Actions

While Optional actions should **generally be skipped**, there are specific situations where an otherwise-routine action becomes worth logging. The key is that something **exceptional** happened that makes the action noteworthy.

#### Elevation Criterion 1: Unexpected Critical Finding

**When to Elevate**: A routine read or search revealed a critical issue, bug, or insight that significantly impacted your implementation.

**Example Scenarios**:
- Reading a file for context and discovering a security vulnerability
- A routine search revealing duplicate implementations that need consolidation
- Opening a config file and finding production credentials hardcoded (security issue)
- Exploring codebase and finding a critical performance bottleneck

**How to Log**:
- ✅ "Discovered hardcoded API keys in config.ts during routine review - moved to environment variables for security" (Essential)
- ✅ "Found duplicate authentication logic in 3 services while exploring codebase - consolidated into shared authService.ts" (Contextual → Essential)

**Why This Elevates**: The discovery itself became a critical issue requiring Essential action. Log the discovery and the fix together.

---

#### Elevation Criterion 2: Complex Debugging Pattern

**When to Elevate**: A series of exploratory actions that eventually identified a root cause, where understanding the investigation process adds value.

**Example Scenarios**:
- Spent 2 hours exploring 15 files to track down race condition
- Multiple searches across different parts of codebase to find memory leak source
- Reading through 10 config files to identify misconfiguration causing deployment failure

**How to Log**:
- ✅ "Investigated timeout issues across API client, network config, and environment settings - identified timeout set too low in apiClient.ts" (Contextual)
- ❌ Don't log each individual file read or search - summarize the pattern

**Why This Elevates**: The debugging complexity demonstrates due diligence and provides context for why the fix took significant effort. But log the **pattern**, not each step.

---

#### Elevation Criterion 3: Research That Changed Approach

**When to Elevate**: Exploratory actions that led to changing your implementation approach, technology choice, or architectural decision.

**Example Scenarios**:
- Reading multiple authentication libraries before choosing one
- Exploring existing patterns that made you change your implementation design
- Documentation reading that revealed a better approach than initially planned

**How to Log**:
- ✅ "Reviewed JWT, OAuth2, and session-based auth approaches - selected JWT for stateless API authentication based on scalability requirements" (Contextual)
- ✅ "Analyzed existing state management patterns in codebase - adapted approach to use Redux toolkit instead of Context API for consistency" (Contextual)

**Why This Elevates**: The research directly influenced a decision. The outcome of the research (the decision) is worth documenting.

---

#### Elevation Criterion 4: Evidence of Critical Validation

**When to Elevate**: Validation steps that prove due diligence for critical changes (security, data integrity, production deployments).

**Example Scenarios**:
- Extensive testing before production deployment
- Security validation before merging sensitive changes
- Data integrity checks before database migration

**How to Log**:
- ✅ "Validated database migration on staging environment with 100K test records - confirmed no data loss before production deployment" (Contextual)
- ✅ "Ran security audit tools on authentication changes - verified no vulnerabilities before merge" (Contextual)
- ❌ "Ran tests" (too vague, Optional)

**Why This Elevates**: The validation provides confidence and demonstrates thoroughness for high-risk changes. Summarize validation, don't enumerate every test.

---

### When NOT to Elevate (Stay Optional)

Even when the above criteria might seem to apply, keep actions Optional if:

1. **The action didn't actually influence anything**
   - You read docs but implemented exactly as you originally planned
   - You searched for existing code but found nothing and continued
   - You validated changes that worked as expected (routine validation)

2. **The action is already implied by other logged actions**
   - You created a file, so obviously you wrote it and checked it
   - You fixed a bug, so obviously you investigated it
   - You updated config, so obviously you read the current config first

3. **The pattern is so common it's unremarkable**
   - Reading files in normal development flow
   - Running standard linter/formatter tools
   - Checking git status before commits
   - Basic code exploration without findings

4. **The value is pure process, not outcome**
   - Listing each file you opened doesn't explain what you built
   - Enumerating searches doesn't show what you found
   - Documenting validation steps doesn't add to understanding the changes

**Key Question**: "If I remove this log entry, would anyone reading the log lose important information about what was built or why?"
- If **NO** → Keep it Optional, skip logging it
- If **YES** → Elevate it, but focus on the outcome/decision, not the process

### Fast Decision Rules (Memorize These)

After using this matrix 5-6 times, you should internalize these patterns:

**Rule 1: CHANGED = ESSENTIAL**
- Created, modified, or deleted ANY file → **Log it**
- Changed configuration or environment → **Log it**
- Fixed a bug or implemented a feature → **Log it**
- Made ANY lasting change to the system → **Log it**

**Rule 2: DISCOVERED = CONTEXTUAL (maybe)**
- Found a pattern that influenced your approach → **Log it**
- Identified root cause of a problem → **Log it**
- Learned something surprising or non-obvious → **Log it**
- Discovered something obvious or expected → **Skip it**

**Rule 3: ROUTINE = OPTIONAL (skip)**
- Read files to understand code → **Skip it**
- Ran searches that found nothing → **Skip it**
- Checked status (git, processes) → **Skip it**
- Navigated or explored → **Skip it**
- Did routine verification → **Skip it**

### Action-Specific Decision Paths

#### Path A: File Operations

```
Did I perform a file operation?
  │
  ├─ Created file    → Essential (Log: path, purpose, key features)
  ├─ Modified file   → Essential (Log: path, what changed, why)
  ├─ Deleted file    → Essential (Log: path, reason)
  ├─ Read file       → Ask: Did this reveal critical info?
  │                     ├─ YES → Contextual (Log: what discovered)
  │                     └─ NO  → Optional (Skip)
  └─ Moved/renamed   → Essential (Log: old path, new path, reason)
```

#### Path B: Search/Investigation Operations

```
Did I search or investigate?
  │
  ├─ Found pattern       → Ask: Did this influence my implementation?
  │                         ├─ YES → Contextual (Log finding + impact)
  │                         └─ NO  → Optional (Skip)
  │
  ├─ Found nothing       → Optional (Skip, unless search was extensive)
  │
  ├─ Identified root     → Contextual (Log: problem + root cause)
  │   cause
  │
  └─ Routine lookup      → Optional (Skip)
```

#### Path C: Validation/Testing Operations

```
Did I validate or test?
  │
  ├─ Test failed         → Contextual (Log: what failed, fix approach)
  │
  ├─ Test passed         → Ask: Was this critical validation?
  │   (after fix)          ├─ YES → Contextual (Log: validated fix)
  │                        └─ NO  → Optional (Skip routine tests)
  │
  ├─ Validation revealed → Contextual (Log: issue + resolution)

      passed
```

#### Path D: Configuration/Environment Operations

```
Did I change configuration or environment?
  │
  ├─ Modified config     → Essential (Log: file, setting, value, reason)

### Reasoning Guide for Edge Cases

When you encounter an action not explicitly covered above, use this reasoning framework:

#### Step 1: Apply the Change Test

**Question**: "Did this action result in a lasting change to the system?"

- **If YES** → Essential (log the change)
- **If NO** → Continue to Step 2

**Examples**:
- ✅ "I refactored a function" → YES (code changed) → Essential
- ❌ "I read 5 files to understand structure" → NO (no change) → Continue

#### Step 2: Apply the Discovery Test

**Question**: "Did this action reveal information that directly influenced what I built or how I built it?"

- **If YES** → Contextual (log the discovery)
- **If NO** → Continue to Step 3

**Examples**:
- ✅ "I discovered the API uses JWT tokens" → YES (influenced auth implementation) → Contextual
- ❌ "I read the README" → NO (routine orientation) → Continue

#### Step 3: Apply the Non-Obvious Test

**Question**: "Would a reviewer wonder 'How did they know to do that?' without this log entry?"

- **If YES** → Contextual (log to explain)
- **If NO** → Continue to Step 4

**Examples**:
- ✅ "I found a critical security vulnerability in code review" → YES (explains urgency) → Contextual
- ❌ "I verified my changes work" → NO (obvious verification) → Continue

#### Step 4: Apply the Routine Test

**Question**: "Is this a routine action that any developer would do as standard practice?"

- **If YES** → Optional (skip it)
- **If NO** → Contextual (consider logging)

**Examples**:
- ✅ "I ran `git status`" → YES (standard workflow) → Skip
- ⚠️ "I spent 2 hours debugging a complex race condition" → NO (exceptional) → Contextual

#### Step 5: When Still Unsure

If you've gone through all 4 steps and still aren't sure, apply the **Value Test**:

**Question**: "If I removed this from the log, would the reader lose important information about what was built, why it was built this way, or how problems were solved?"

- **If YES** → Log it (as Contextual)
- **If NO** → Skip it

---

### Edge Case Examples

Here are common edge cases with reasoning:

#### Edge Case 1: Extensive Research That Led Nowhere

**Scenario**: Spent 30 minutes searching for a library to solve a problem, found nothing, implemented custom solution.

**Reasoning**:
- Did it change system? NO (research only)
- Did it influence decision? YES (decided to build custom)
- Is it non-obvious? YES (explains why custom)

**Decision**: **Contextual** - Log the failed research and decision

**Log Entry Example**:
```
Researched existing JWT validation libraries (jsonwebtoken, jose, passport-jwt)
Found none met requirements (need RS256 + refresh token rotation + custom claims)
Decision: Implement custom JWT validation using crypto library
```

#### Edge Case 2: Reading Files You Created Earlier in Same Session

**Scenario**: Created `UserService.ts`, then 10 minutes later read it to understand your own code.

**Reasoning**:
- Did it change system? NO (reading only)
- Is this routine? YES (verifying your own work)

**Decision**: **Optional** - Skip it

**Rationale**: You created the file (logged), reading it back is routine verification.

#### Edge Case 3: Debugging That Revealed Multiple False Leads

**Scenario**: Investigated 5 different potential causes of a bug, 4 were false leads, 1 was correct.

**Reasoning**:
- Did you change system? YES (fixed the bug - Essential)
- Do false leads add value? MAYBE (show complexity)
- Would reader wonder about process? NO (outcome matters)

**Decision**:
- **Essential**: Log the bug fix with final root cause
- **Contextual**: Log ONE summary of false leads IF they reveal complexity
- **Optional**: Skip individual false lead investigations

**Log Entry Example**:
```
Essential: Fixed race condition in UserService.updateProfile() causing intermittent 500 errors
- Root cause: Multiple simultaneous updates to user profile not properly locked
- Solution: Added database transaction with SELECT FOR UPDATE

Contextual: Investigated 4 potential causes (network timeout, cache invalidation,
database connection pool, async/await ordering) before identifying race condition
```

#### Edge Case 4: Running the Same Test Multiple Times

**Scenario**: Implemented feature, ran tests 10 times while fixing issues iteratively.

**Reasoning**:
- Did tests change? NO (running only)
- Is this routine? YES (standard TDD workflow)
- Does each run add value? NO (only final success matters)

**Decision**:
- **Optional**: Skip intermediate test runs
- **Contextual**: Log final test success that validates your implementation

**Log Entry Example**:
```
Contextual: Verified UserProfile feature with comprehensive test suite
- 12 unit tests: all passing
- 3 integration tests: all passing
- Coverage: 94% (target: 90%)
```

#### Edge Case 5: Pair Programming / Collaboration

**Scenario**: Collaborated with another developer who suggested an approach.

**Reasoning**:
- Did you implement it? YES (if you made changes - Essential)
- Does collaboration add context? YES (explains decision)
- Is credit important? YES (attribution matters)

**Decision**:
- **Essential**: Log the implementation changes you made
- **Contextual**: Add note about collaboration/suggestion in the rationale

**Log Entry Example**:
```
Essential: Refactored authentication flow to use middleware pattern
- Created AuthMiddleware.ts with JWT validation
- Updated app.ts to apply middleware to protected routes
- Rationale: Suggested by @colleague during pair review; improves testability and separation of concerns
```

### Memory Aids

These mnemonics help you remember the framework without referencing the matrix:

**The C-D-R Pattern**:
- **C**hanged → Essential (CHANGE = LOG)
- **D**iscovered → Contextual (DISCOVERY = MAYBE)
- **R**outine → Optional (ROUTINE = SKIP)

**The 3 Questions**:
1. "Did I **create** something?" → Yes = Essential
2. "Did I **learn** something?" → Yes = Contextual (if notable)
3. "Did I **check** something?" → Yes = Optional (skip it)

**The Value Hierarchy**:
```
High Value (Essential):    Actions that CHANGE the system
Medium Value (Contextual): Actions that EXPLAIN decisions
Low Value (Optional):      Actions that just HAPPEN (routine)
```

---

### Self-Check After Using Matrix

After you've used this matrix 5-6 times, test yourself:

1. ✅ Can I classify "created new file" in 1 second? (Answer: Essential)
2. ✅ Can I classify "read 10 files during exploration" in 2 seconds? (Answer: Optional/Skip)
3. ✅ Can I classify "search found critical security issue" in 3 seconds? (Answer: Contextual)
4. ✅ Can I explain why "changed config" is Essential? (Answer: Changes system state)
5. ✅ Can I reason about an edge case using the 5-step framework?

If you answered YES to all 5, you've internalized the matrix. You should rarely need to reference it again for common actions.

| Aspect | Essential | Contextual | Optional |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **System Impact** | Changes the system | No change, but informs | No change, routine |
| **Value** | Critical understanding | Helpful context | Minimal value |
| **Frequency** | Log always | Log selectively | Skip generally |
| **Focus** | What changed & why | Why decisions were made | Process details |
| **Examples** | File creation, config change, fix implemented | Complex search, critical read, validation | Routine reads, status checks, exploration |

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: File Creation Flow

**Scenario**: Creating a new React component

**Actions performed**:
1. Read existing component files to understand patterns
2. Create new component file `Button.tsx`
3. Write component code with TypeScript
4. Read the file to verify syntax
5. Create test file `Button.test.tsx`
6. Write unit tests
7. Run tests to verify they pass

**What to log**:
- ✅ **Essential**: Created `/frontend/src/components/Button.tsx` (new component with props interface)
- ✅ **Essential**: Created `/frontend/src/components/Button.test.tsx` (unit tests with 95% coverage)
- ✅ **Contextual**: Ran tests to verify Button component functionality (all 8 tests passed)
- ❌ **Skip**: Reading existing components (routine exploration)
- ❌ **Skip**: Reading the file after writing (routine verification)

### Example 2: Debugging a Complex Issue

**Scenario**: Investigating why API calls fail intermittently

**Actions performed**:
1. Read API client code
2. Read network configuration
3. Search for timeout settings across codebase
4. Read environment variables configuration
5. Discover timeout set to 1000ms (too low)
6. Read service documentation to find recommended timeout
7. Update timeout to 30000ms
8. Test API calls
9. Verify issue resolved

**What to log**:
- ✅ **Contextual**: Searched codebase for timeout configurations to diagnose intermittent API failures
- ✅ **Contextual**: Discovered timeout was set to 1000ms, causing failures for slow endpoints
- ✅ **Essential**: Updated API client timeout from 1000ms to 30000ms in `/frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts`
- ✅ **Contextual**: Verified fix by testing API calls to slow endpoints (all succeeded)
- ❌ **Skip**: Reading individual files during investigation (routine exploration)
- ❌ **Skip**: Each individual test run (summarized in verification)

### Example 3: Configuration Change

**Scenario**: Updating Docker configuration for production

**Actions performed**:
1. Read current Dockerfile
2. Read Docker Compose file
3. Search for environment variable usage
4. Update Dockerfile with new build arguments
5. Update docker-compose.yml with new environment variables
6. Read updated files to verify changes
7. Test container build locally
8. Push changes to Git

**What to log**:
- ✅ **Essential**: Updated `/docker/Dockerfile` to add `NODE_ENV` build argument for environment-specific builds
- ✅ **Essential**: Updated `/docker-compose.yml` to add `API_TIMEOUT` and `API_RETRY_COUNT` environment variables for production reliability
- ✅ **Contextual**: Tested container build locally to verify configuration changes (build succeeded, container started correctly)
- ✅ **Essential**: Committed configuration changes (commit: "Add production environment configuration for API reliability")
- ❌ **Skip**: Reading files before changes (routine preparation)
- ❌ **Skip**: Reading files after changes (routine verification)

## Good vs Bad Logging Examples

This section provides side-by-side comparisons of good logging practices versus bad logging practices. Each comparison shows what ineffective implementation logs look like (too verbose, lacking context, wrong level, etc.) versus what effective logs should contain (appropriate detail level, clear outcomes, valuable context).

Study these examples to recognize patterns in your own logging and self-correct when your logs resemble the "bad" patterns.

---

### Comparison 1: Creating a New Feature (Verbosity Problem)

#### ❌ BAD: Too Verbose, Process-Focused

```
Read: /frontend/src/components/Header.tsx to understand component structure
Read: /frontend/src/components/Navigation.tsx to see navigation patterns
Read: /frontend/src/styles/theme.ts to check color variables
Searched for "button" in codebase to find button patterns (found 23 files)
Read: /frontend/src/components/Button.tsx to understand button implementation
Read: /frontend/src/components/Button.test.tsx to see testing approach
Created: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx
Wrote initial component skeleton
Read: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx to verify skeleton
Added useState hook for search input
Read: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx to verify hook
Added search icon import
Read: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx to check imports
Added handleSearch function
Read: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx to verify function
Added input styling
Read: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx to check styling
Created: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.test.tsx
Wrote first test case
Read: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.test.tsx to verify test
Wrote second test case
Read: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.test.tsx to verify test
Ran tests (2 passed)
Read test output to confirm success
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
- **Too Verbose**: 23 log entries for creating a single component
- **Process-Focused**: Documents every tiny step, not the outcomes
- **Wrong Level**: Logs Optional actions (routine reads) as if they're Essential
- **Cluttered**: Reader must wade through noise to find what actually changed
- **Token Waste**: Consumes excessive tokens without adding value
- **Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Maybe 3 useful entries out of 23

#### ✅ GOOD: Concise, Outcome-Focused

```
Created: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx
Purpose: Reusable search input component with icon and debounced search functionality
Key features: Controlled input with useState, debounced search handler (300ms), accessible ARIA labels

Created: /frontend/src/components/SearchBar.test.tsx
Coverage: 95% (8 test cases covering render, input change, debounced search, accessibility)
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- **Concise**: 2 log entries capture all Essential information
- **Outcome-Focused**: Documents what was built, not how it was built
- **Appropriate Level**: Essential actions (file creation) logged; Optional actions (reads) skipped
- **High Value**: Reader immediately understands what changed and why
- **Efficient**: Minimal tokens with maximum information
- **High Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: 100% signal, zero noise

---

### Comparison 2: Fixing a Bug (Lacking Context Problem)

#### ❌ BAD: Lacking Context, No "Why"

```
Modified: /backend/api/services/payment.py
Changed line 45
Modified: /backend/api/tests/test_payment.py
Added test
Ran tests (all passed)
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
- **No Context**: What bug was fixed? What was the root cause?
- **Missing "Why"**: Reader doesn't understand the problem or solution
- **Unclear Changes**: "Changed line 45" tells nothing about what changed
- **No Value for Debugging**: If bug reoccurs, this log provides zero help
- **Incomplete**: What was the test validating? Why was it added?
- **Low Confidence**: Reader can't assess if fix was appropriate

#### ✅ GOOD: Clear Context, Explains "Why"

```
Fixed: Payment processing bug causing double charges on retry attempts

Root cause: Payment service didn't check for existing pending transactions before creating new charge
Impact: Affected ~15 users in production who experienced network timeouts during payment

Modified: /backend/api/services/payment.py
- Added `check_pending_transaction()` method to verify no duplicate charges
- Updated `process_payment()` to call check before creating Stripe charge
- Added transaction deduplication using payment_intent_id

Modified: /backend/api/tests/test_payment.py
- Added test_no_duplicate_charge_on_retry() verifying duplicate prevention
- Added test_existing_pending_transaction_handling() for edge cases

Verified: All payment tests pass (12/12), including new deduplication tests
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- **Clear Context**: Explains what bug was fixed and why it mattered
- **Root Cause Included**: Future developers understand the problem
- **Specific Changes**: Lists actual changes, not just "changed line 45"
- **Test Coverage Explained**: Clear what tests validate and why they matter
- **Debugging Value**: If bug reoccurs, this log helps diagnose it
- **High Confidence**: Reader can assess if fix addresses the root cause

---

### Comparison 3: Making Configuration Changes (Wrong Level Problem)

#### ❌ BAD: Wrong Logging Level, Treats Optional as Essential

```
Read: /config/database.yml to check current settings
Checked database connection status (connected)
Read: /config/redis.yml to check Redis configuration
Checked Redis connection status (connected)
Read: /config/app.yml to review application settings
Searched for "timeout" in config files (found 8 matches)
Read: /docs/deployment-guide.md to understand timeout requirements
Read: /config/environments/production.yml to check production settings
Modified: /config/app.yml
Changed timeout value
Read: /config/app.yml to verify change
Checked configuration syntax (valid)
Ran configuration validation script (passed)
Read validation output to confirm
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
- **Wrong Level**: Logs routine reads and checks as if they're Essential
- **Noise Dominates**: 14 entries, only 1 is actually Essential (the modification)
- **Status Checks Logged**: Connection status checks are Optional noise
- **Verification Overkill**: Logging every verification step adds no value
- **Dilutes Important Changes**: The actual config change is buried in noise
- **Reader Fatigue**: Must scan through clutter to find the one important change

#### ✅ GOOD: Correct Logging Levels Applied

```
Modified: /config/app.yml
Changed API timeout from 30s to 90s to accommodate slower third-party endpoints
Rationale: Production logs showed 12% of requests timing out at 30s; 90s eliminates timeouts while maintaining reasonable UX
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- **Essential Only**: Logs only the state-changing action (config modification)
- **Skips Optional Noise**: Omits routine reads, status checks, verification steps
- **Includes Rationale**: Explains why the change was made (production data)
- **Specific Values**: Shows old value (30s) and new value (90s)
- **Business Context**: Reader understands impact on users and system
- **Concise**: Single focused entry instead of 14 scattered entries

---

### Comparison 4: Debugging Investigation (Missing Discovery Pattern)

#### ❌ BAD: Logs Process, Misses Discovery

```
Read: /frontend/src/api/client.ts
Read: /frontend/src/api/interceptors.ts
Read: /frontend/src/api/auth.ts
Read: /frontend/src/utils/storage.ts
Searched for "localStorage" in frontend code
Read: /frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.ts
Read: /frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
Read: /frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx
Modified: /frontend/src/api/auth.ts
Added token refresh logic
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
- **Process-Focused**: Lists every file read during investigation
- **Missing Discovery**: Doesn't explain what was discovered or why it matters
- **No Pattern Recognition**: Multiple files read but no insight shared
- **Unclear Problem**: Reader doesn't know what bug was being debugged
- **Missing Context**: Why was token refresh needed? What was broken?
- **Low Contextual Value**: Investigation didn't result in Contextual log explaining findings

#### ✅ GOOD: Highlights Discovery, Provides Context

```
Investigated: Authentication token expiration causing unexpected logouts

Discovery: Token refresh logic was missing - app stored initial access token in localStorage but never refreshed it when expired (30-minute expiry)
Pattern found: All auth-related files accessed localStorage directly without centralized token management
Impact: Users experienced logout every 30 minutes, requiring re-authentication

Modified: /frontend/src/api/auth.ts
- Added `refreshAccessToken()` function to handle automatic token renewal
- Added `isTokenExpired()` utility to check token validity before API calls
- Integrated refresh logic into API interceptor for automatic renewal

Result: Token auto-refreshes before expiry, eliminating unexpected logouts
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- **Discovery Logged**: Explains what was found during investigation (missing refresh logic)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Notes the pattern of direct localStorage access
- **Problem Context**: Reader understands the bug and its user impact
- **Solution Explained**: Clear what was implemented and why
- **Outcome Included**: Shows the result (no more unexpected logouts)
- **Contextual Value**: Investigation findings logged as Contextual, providing valuable debugging insight

---

### Comparison 5: Adding Tests (Over-Documentation Problem)

#### ❌ BAD: Over-Documents Testing Process

```
Created: /backend/tests/test_user_service.py
Wrote test_create_user()
Ran test_create_user() (passed)
Wrote test_update_user()
Ran test_update_user() (passed)
Wrote test_delete_user()
Ran test_delete_user() (passed)
Wrote test_get_user()
Ran test_get_user() (passed)
Wrote test_list_users()
Ran test_list_users() (passed)
Ran all tests together (5 passed)
Read test output to verify coverage
Ran coverage report (85% coverage)
Read coverage report to check uncovered lines
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
- **Over-Documents Process**: Logs every individual test write and run
- **Repetitive**: Each test documented identically, adding zero information
- **Test Runs Logged**: Running tests is verification, not a system change
- **Coverage Overkill**: Both running coverage and reading coverage logged
- **Process Noise**: The process of testing drowns out the outcome
- **Wasted Tokens**: 15 entries when 1-2 would suffice

#### ✅ GOOD: Summarizes Test Coverage, Focuses on Outcome

```
Created: /backend/tests/test_user_service.py
Coverage: 85% (5 test cases covering CRUD operations)
Tests:
- User creation with validation (email format, password strength)
- User update with permission checks (user can only update own profile)
- User deletion with soft-delete logic (preserves audit trail)
- User retrieval with privacy filtering (excludes sensitive fields)
- User list with pagination and filtering (role-based access)

Gap: 15% uncovered - edge case for concurrent user updates (acceptable for v1)
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- **Summarizes Testing**: Single entry covers all test work
- **Outcome-Focused**: Documents what tests validate, not the process of writing them
- **Coverage Noted**: Includes coverage percentage and what's covered
- **Key Test Scenarios**: Lists important test cases with their purpose
- **Identifies Gaps**: Notes uncovered areas and rationale for accepting gap
- **Efficient**: 1 comprehensive entry instead of 15 process entries

---

### Comparison 6: Refactoring Code (No Rationale Problem)

#### ❌ BAD: No Explanation Why Refactor Happened

```
Modified: /backend/api/views/product.py
Refactored code
Modified: /backend/api/views/category.py
Refactored code
Modified: /backend/api/views/order.py
Refactored code
Modified: /backend/api/serializers/product.py
Refactored code
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
- **No Rationale**: "Refactored code" explains nothing about what or why
- **Missing Context**: Reader doesn't know what problem was solved
- **Unclear Changes**: What specifically changed? What's different now?
- **No Value Assessment**: Was this refactor worth the risk?
- **Future Confusion**: If bugs appear, this log provides zero debugging help
- **Vague**: "Refactored" could mean anything from rename to complete rewrite

#### ✅ GOOD: Clear Refactor Purpose and Changes

```
Refactored: API views to eliminate code duplication across product, category, and order endpoints

Problem: 3 view files contained identical permission checking, pagination, and filtering logic (~120 lines duplicated across files)
Risk: Bug fixes required updating 3 files; inconsistencies already present in permission logic

Changes:
- Created /backend/api/views/base.py with BaseModelViewSet containing shared logic
- Modified /backend/api/views/product.py to inherit from BaseModelViewSet (removed 45 lines)
- Modified /backend/api/views/category.py to inherit from BaseModelViewSet (removed 42 lines)
- Modified /backend/api/views/order.py to inherit from BaseModelViewSet (removed 38 lines)
- Updated serializers to use shared validation methods

Benefits: Single source of truth for permissions, pagination, filtering; reduced codebase by 125 lines; eliminated 3 known permission inconsistencies
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- **Clear Rationale**: Explains why refactor was needed (code duplication)
- **Problem Stated**: Reader understands the pain being solved
- **Risk Context**: Notes the risk of duplication (bug fixes need 3 updates)
- **Specific Changes**: Lists exactly what changed and where
- **Benefits Quantified**: Shows value (125 lines removed, inconsistencies fixed)
- **Debugging Value**: If issues arise, reader knows what code was consolidated

---

### Comparison 7: Environment Setup (Routine vs Critical Distinction Missing)

#### ❌ BAD: Treats All Environment Actions as Equal

```
Checked Node.js version (v18.17.0)
Checked npm version (9.8.1)
Ran npm install
Read package-lock.json to verify dependencies
Checked Python version (3.11.2)
Checked pip version (23.1.2)
Ran pip install -r requirements.txt
Read requirements.txt to verify packages
Set environment variable DATABASE_URL
Set environment variable REDIS_URL
Set environment variable SECRET_KEY
Set environment variable API_KEY
Checked environment variables are set (all present)
Started development server
Checked server is running (running on port 3000)
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
- **No Distinction**: Treats version checks (Optional) same as config changes (Essential)
- **Routine Checks Logged**: Version checks and status checks are noise
- **Installation Logged**: Standard npm/pip install is routine, not Essential
- **Missing Criticality**: SECRET_KEY and API_KEY are security-critical, but log doesn't highlight this
- **Verification Overkill**: Checking that checks worked adds no value
- **Buries Important Info**: Critical environment variables are buried in routine setup noise

#### ✅ GOOD: Highlights Critical Environment Changes, Skips Routine Setup

```
Configured: Production environment variables for staging deployment

Critical security settings:
- Set SECRET_KEY (32-char random string for session encryption)
- Set API_KEY for third-party payment gateway integration

Database and cache:
- Set DATABASE_URL pointing to staging PostgreSQL instance
- Set REDIS_URL for session storage and caching

Note: Development dependencies installed via standard npm install and pip install (Node v18.17.0, Python 3.11.2)
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- **Critical First**: Highlights security-critical environment variables
- **Grouped by Purpose**: Related variables grouped (security, database, cache)
- **Context Provided**: Explains what each variable is used for
- **Routine Setup Noted**: Acknowledges standard setup without logging every step
- **Security Aware**: Reader immediately sees security-critical configuration
- **Environment Clarity**: Clear this is staging deployment configuration

---

### Key Patterns: Self-Check Your Logs

After reviewing these 7 comparisons, use this checklist to self-correct your logging:

#### ❌ Your logs might be BAD if:
- [ ] You're logging 20+ actions for a single feature implementation
- [ ] You're logging "Read: [file]" for every file you read
- [ ] You're using vague descriptions like "Changed code" or "Fixed it"
- [ ] You're logging every test run and every verification step
- [ ] Your log contains more Optional actions than Essential actions
- [ ] Someone reading your log wouldn't understand what you actually built
- [ ] You're documenting every step of your process, not the outcomes

#### ✅ Your logs are GOOD if:
- [ ] Each log entry clearly states what changed in the system
- [ ] You explain why changes were made (root cause, business reason, rationale)
- [ ] You skip routine reads, status checks, and verification steps
- [ ] You summarize repetitive actions (e.g., "5 tests" not "test 1, test 2, test 3...")
- [ ] You include context for debugging (discoveries, patterns, failed approaches when relevant)
- [ ] Someone reading your log could understand the implementation without seeing the code
- [ ] You're documenting outcomes (what was built) not process (how you built it)

**The Ultimate Test**: If you removed all Optional noise from your log, would the remaining Essential and Contextual entries tell a clear story of what was accomplished? If yes, your logging is effective. If no, you're likely over-logging process details.

---

## Outcome-Focused vs Process-Focused Logging

### Core Definitions

**Outcome-Focused Logging** documents **what was accomplished** - the end result, the change made, the problem solved. It answers "What did you achieve?" and "Why did you do it?"

**Process-Focused Logging** documents **how it was accomplished** - every step taken, every tool used, every file read. It answers "What did you do?" and "How did you do it?"

### The Golden Rule

**Log outcomes (what was accomplished), not processes (how it was accomplished).**

### What to Focus On

Implementation logs should focus on:
- ✅ **What changed** in the system (the outcome)
- ✅ **Why** those changes were made (the rationale)
- ✅ **What problems** were solved (the value delivered)
- ✅ **What decisions** were made (the choices and trade-offs)
- ✅ **What was discovered** that influenced the approach (meaningful findings)

### What to Avoid

Implementation logs should NOT focus on:
- ❌ Every individual step taken to reach the outcome
- ❌ Every tool invocation or command executed
- ❌ Every file read during exploration or research
- ❌ The chronological sequence of actions performed
- ❌ Intermediate verification or routine checks
- ❌ Process details that don't add context or value

### Process vs Outcome Examples

#### Example 1: Adding a New Feature

**❌ Process-Focused (Too Verbose)**:
```
1. Read App.tsx to understand current routing
2. Read existing page components to understand structure
3. Read routing configuration
4. Created new file ProfilePage.tsx
5. Wrote ProfilePage component code
6. Read App.tsx again to add route
7. Updated App.tsx to add /profile route
8. Read package.json to check dependencies
9. Imported ProfilePage in App.tsx
10. Ran development server to test
11. Navigated to /profile to verify it works
12. Read ProfilePage.tsx to review code
```

**✅ Outcome-Focused (Appropriate)**:
```
1. Created ProfilePage component at /frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx with user profile display functionality
2. Added /profile route to application routing in /frontend/src/App.tsx
3. Verified ProfilePage renders correctly at /profile route
```

#### Example 2: Fixing a Bug

**❌ Process-Focused (Too Verbose)**:
```
1. Read issue description #123
2. Read LoginForm.tsx to understand current implementation
3. Read authentication service code
4. Searched for "password validation" across codebase
5. Found validation in authService.ts
6. Read authService.ts to understand validation logic
7. Discovered validation regex was incorrect
8. Searched for password regex patterns in other files
9. Read documentation for password requirements
10. Updated regex pattern in authService.ts
11. Read the file to verify change
12. Ran tests
13. All tests passed
```

**✅ Outcome-Focused (Appropriate)**:
```
1. Identified incorrect password validation regex in /frontend/src/services/authService.ts (was rejecting valid special characters)
2. Updated password validation regex to accept all required special characters according to security policy
3. Verified fix with existing test suite (12 tests passed including new edge cases)
```

#### Example 3: Refactoring Code

**❌ Process-Focused (Too Verbose)**:
```
1. Read Button.tsx
2. Read Input.tsx
3. Read Checkbox.tsx
4. Noticed all three components duplicate focus styling logic
5. Read theme configuration to understand focus styles
6. Decided to extract common styling
7. Created new file focusStyles.ts
8. Wrote extractFocusStyles utility function
9. Read Button.tsx to update it
10. Updated Button.tsx to use utility
11. Read Input.tsx to update it
12. Updated Input.tsx to use utility
13. Read Checkbox.tsx to update it
14. Updated Checkbox.tsx to use utility
15. Ran tests for each component
16. All tests passed
```

**✅ Outcome-Focused (Appropriate)**:
```
1. Extracted duplicate focus styling logic from Button, Input, and Checkbox components into shared utility /frontend/src/utils/focusStyles.ts
2. Updated Button.tsx, Input.tsx, and Checkbox.tsx to use centralized focus styling utility
3. Verified refactoring didn't break functionality (36 component tests passed)
```

#### Example 4: Complex Multi-Step Database Migration (10+ Substeps)

**Scenario**: Migrating from MongoDB to PostgreSQL for better relational data support

**❌ Process-Focused (Too Verbose - 15 steps)**:
```
1. Read current MongoDB schema definitions
2. Read user model file
3. Read order model file
4. Read product model file
5. Searched for all MongoDB queries across codebase
6. Found 47 MongoDB queries in 12 files
7. Read PostgreSQL documentation for schema design
8. Created new PostgreSQL schema file
9. Wrote migration script to export MongoDB data
10. Tested migration script on development database
11. Fixed 3 bugs in migration script
12. Created PostgreSQL database tables
13. Ran migration script to transfer data
14. Verified data integrity by comparing record counts
15. Updated all 47 queries to use PostgreSQL syntax
16. Tested each updated query individually
17. Ran full test suite (found 8 failures)
18. Fixed 8 test failures related to query syntax
19. Ran test suite again (all passed)
20. Updated database connection configuration
21. Documented migration process
```

**✅ Outcome-Focused (Appropriate - 4 entries)**:
```
1. Designed PostgreSQL schema based on existing MongoDB models (User, Order, Product) with normalized relational structure at /backend/database/schema.sql
2. Created migration script at /backend/scripts/migrate-mongo-to-postgres.ts that exports MongoDB data and imports to PostgreSQL with data validation
3. Updated 47 database queries across 12 files to use PostgreSQL syntax (primarily in /backend/services/ and /backend/repositories/)
4. Verified migration success: all 1,247 records transferred correctly, test suite passes (156 tests), performance improved by 40% for join queries
```

**Key Insight**: This complex task involved 20+ individual steps, but the implementation log captures the 4 essential outcomes. Someone reading this log understands what was accomplished without wading through every intermediate action.

#### Example 5: Setting Up CI/CD Pipeline

**Scenario**: Adding automated testing and deployment pipeline

**❌ Process-Focused (Too Verbose)**:
```
1. Read existing project structure to understand build process
2. Checked if .github/workflows directory exists
3. Created .github/workflows directory
4. Read GitHub Actions documentation for syntax
5. Created ci.yml file
6. Added checkout action to workflow
7. Added Node.js setup action
8. Read package.json to identify test command
9. Added npm install step
10. Added npm test step
11. Added build step
12. Pushed changes to test workflow
13. Workflow failed - checked logs
14. Fixed Node version mismatch
15. Pushed fix
16. Workflow failed again - checked logs
17. Fixed missing environment variable
18. Pushed fix
19. Workflow succeeded
20. Created separate deployment workflow
21. Added deployment steps...
```

**✅ Outcome-Focused (Appropriate)**:
```
1. Created GitHub Actions CI workflow at /.github/workflows/ci.yml that runs tests and builds on every pull request
2. Created deployment workflow at /.github/workflows/deploy.yml that deploys to staging on merge to develop and production on merge to main
3. Configured environment variables for CI: NODE_ENV, API_KEY, DATABASE_URL
4. Resolved initial workflow issues: set Node.js version to 18.x and added required environment variables
5. Verified both workflows execute successfully: CI completes in 3min 45sec, deployment completes in 5min 20sec
```

### When Process Details Matter

Most of the time, outcome-focused logging is appropriate. However, there are specific scenarios where including process details adds significant value to the implementation log.

#### Criteria for Process-Focused Logging

Include process details when:

1. **Complex Problem Solving with Non-Obvious Path**
   - The solution required investigating multiple potential causes
   - The debugging path reveals important system insights
   - Future developers might face the same issue and benefit from seeing the investigation approach

   **Example**:
   - ✅ **Good**: "Investigated three potential causes: (1) network timeout - eliminated by testing with increased timeout, (2) memory leak - ruled out via profiling, (3) race condition in state updates - confirmed via logging, leading to fix using useCallback hook"
   - ❌ **Bad**: Listing every file read, every console.log statement added, every browser refresh

2. **Failed Approaches That Inform Future Decisions**
   - You tried an approach that seems logical but failed for non-obvious reasons
   - Others might attempt the same approach and need to know why it won't work
   - The failure reveals important constraints or limitations

   **Example**:
   - ✅ **Good**: "Attempted to implement real-time sync using WebSockets but encountered serverless platform limitations (no persistent connections); pivoted to polling with exponential backoff which works within platform constraints"
   - ❌ **Bad**: Listing every WebSocket library tested and every configuration attempted

3. **Research That Involved Significant Trade-Off Analysis**
   - Multiple viable solutions existed with different pros/cons
   - The decision criteria and evaluation process provide value
   - Understanding why you chose option A over B/C/D matters for future maintenance

   **Example**:
   - ✅ **Good**: "Evaluated 3 state management solutions: Redux (most mature, high boilerplate), MobX (simpler API, less community support), Zustand (minimal API, sufficient for our needs). Selected Zustand based on simplicity and team velocity priorities."
   - ❌ **Bad**: Listing every documentation page read, every tutorial followed, every example project examined

4. **Debugging Complex Issues Requiring Deep Investigation**
   - The issue was difficult to reproduce or diagnose
   - The investigation revealed systemic issues or architectural problems
   - The debugging process uncovered multiple related issues

   **Example**:
   - ✅ **Good**: "Memory leak investigation revealed: (1) event listeners not cleaned up in useEffect, (2) React DevTools showed 50+ zombie components, (3) Redux state growing unbounded due to missing cleanup actions. Fixed all three issues."
   - ❌ **Bad**: Listing every memory snapshot taken, every profiling session run, every component inspected

5. **Architecture Decisions With Multiple Valid Options**
   - The decision has long-term implications for the system
   - Multiple approaches were prototyped or seriously considered
   - Future architectural decisions might reference this choice

   **Example**:
   - ✅ **Good**: "Prototyped 2 microservice communication patterns: (1) synchronous REST (simpler, higher latency), (2) async message queue (complex, better scalability). Selected message queue approach because user analytics requires handling 10K+ events/second."
   - ❌ **Bad**: Listing every article read, every architecture diagram drawn, every meeting discussion point

#### Decision Framework: Outcome vs Process

Use this quick test to decide whether to include process details:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Ask: "Will someone benefit from knowing HOW I arrived   │
│      at this solution, not just WHAT the solution is?"  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
           │
           ├─── YES, because the path was complex and
           │    non-obvious, and others might face the
           │    same challenge
           │    └──> Include SUMMARY of process with key
           │         decision points (not every step)
           │
           └─── NO, the solution is self-explanatory
                or the path was straightforward
                └──> Use outcome-focused logging only

```

#### How to Include Process Details (When Appropriate)

When you determine process details add value:

1. **Summarize, Don't Enumerate**: Describe the approach in 2-3 sentences, not step-by-step
2. **Focus on Decision Points**: Highlight key choices made during the process
3. **Explain Why**: Make it clear why certain paths were chosen or rejected
4. **Keep It Relevant**: Only include process details that provide insight

**Example of Good Process Inclusion**:
```
Problem: API response times degraded from 200ms to 3000ms after recent deployment
Investigation approach: Profiled database queries (found N+1 issue in user relationships),
analyzed API endpoint metrics (identified /users/feed as bottleneck), reviewed recent code
changes (found eager loading removed in commit abc123)
Solution: Re-implemented eager loading for user relationships, reducing queries from
500+ to 3 per request
Result: Response times restored to 180ms average
```

This includes process details (the investigation approach) because the debugging path reveals the root cause discovery method, which adds value beyond just stating "fixed N+1 query issue."

## Best Practices

### DO:

1. **Focus on Outcomes**: What changed and why
2. **Summarize Patterns**: "Read 10 component files to understand state management patterns" instead of listing each file
3. **Provide Context**: Explain why decisions were made
4. **Log Decisions**: Document architectural choices and trade-offs
5. **Batch Related Actions**: Group related changes into single log entries
6. **Use Clear Language**: Write for someone who will read the log months later

### DON'T:

1. **Log Every Tool Call**: Don't document every read, search, or status check
2. **Duplicate Information**: Don't log the same action multiple times
3. **Log Routine Process**: Don't document expected workflow steps
4. **Over-Explain Obvious**: Don't explain standard practices
5. **Log for Logging's Sake**: Every log entry should add value
6. **Include Implementation Details in Essential Logs**: Save code-level details for code review, not implementation logs

---

## Self-Check Questions

Before logging an action, ask yourself:

1. **Value Test**: Does this log entry help someone understand what changed or why?
2. **Uniqueness Test**: Is this information already obvious from other logged actions?
3. **Outcome Test**: Am I logging what was accomplished or just what I did?
4. **Signal Test**: Will someone reading this log be glad this entry exists?
5. **Time Test**: Would I want to read this entry if I were reviewing the log 6 months from now?

If you answer "NO" to most of these questions, skip logging that action.

---

## Implementation Log Structure

When logging actions, use this structure:

### Essential Logs
```
[Action Type]: [What Changed] in [File/Location]
Context: [Why this change was needed]
```

**Example**:
```
Created: New authentication middleware in /backend/middleware/auth.ts
Context: Implement JWT token validation for protected API routes
```

### Contextual Logs
```
[Action Type]: [What Was Discovered/Validated]
Context: [How this informed implementation]
```

**Example**:
```
Investigation: Identified timeout configuration issue in API client
Context: API calls were failing intermittently due to 1000ms timeout being too aggressive for slow endpoints
```

---

## Logging for Different Agent Types

Different specialized agents perform different types of work, but all should follow the three-tier logging framework. This section provides agent-specific examples showing how to apply Essential, Contextual, and Optional logging to the typical actions each agent performs.

### Frontend Developer

Frontend developers work with UI components, styling, routing, and client-side state management. Here are concrete examples of how to apply the logging framework to typical frontend actions:

#### Example 1: Creating a New React Component (Essential)

**Scenario**: You create a new UserProfileCard component for displaying user information.

**Why Essential**: Creating a new component fundamentally expands the application's UI capabilities. This is a state-changing operation that must be logged.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /frontend/src/components/UserProfileCard.tsx
Purpose: Displays user avatar, name, bio, and social links in a card layout
Features: Responsive design, loading states, error handling
Props: userId (string), showSocialLinks (boolean), compact (boolean)
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: /frontend/src/components/UserCard.tsx to understand existing card patterns
❌ Read: /frontend/src/styles/theme.ts to check available colors
❌ Searched for "card component" patterns in existing codebase
```

**Why**: Reading existing components and exploring patterns is routine preparation, not a system change.

---

#### Example 2: Updating Application Routing (Essential)

**Scenario**: You add a new route for the user profile page and update the navigation structure.

**Why Essential**: Routing changes affect how users navigate the application. This is a fundamental architectural change.

**What to Log**:
```
Modified: /frontend/src/routes/index.tsx
Added route: /profile/:userId for UserProfilePage component
Updated navigation: Added "Profile" link to main navigation menu
Access control: Route requires authentication
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: /frontend/src/routes/index.tsx to understand current routing structure
❌ Checked react-router documentation for route parameters syntax
❌ Verified route navigation works in browser
```

**Why**: Reading routing config and checking documentation are routine preparation steps.

---

#### Example 3: Investigating Performance Bottleneck (Contextual)

**Scenario**: You profile the UserList component and discover it's re-rendering excessively, leading you to implement React.memo.

**Why Contextual**: The investigation revealed a non-obvious performance issue that influenced your optimization approach. This provides valuable context for why you made certain changes.

**What to Log**:
```
Investigation: Profiled UserList component rendering performance
Finding: Component re-renders 50+ times per scroll due to parent state updates
Analysis: User object references change on every fetch, breaking React equality checks
Decision: Implemented React.memo with custom comparison function for user objects
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: UserList.tsx to understand component structure
❌ Installed React DevTools Profiler
❌ Ran profiler 3 times to collect consistent data
```

**Why**: Reading the component and running profiling tools are routine investigation steps. Log the findings and decisions, not the investigation process.

---

#### Example 4: Updating Component Styling (Essential vs Optional)

**Scenario A (Essential)**: You update the theme configuration to add a new color palette for dark mode.

**What to Log**:
```
Modified: /frontend/src/styles/theme.ts
Added: Dark mode color palette with 12 semantic color tokens
Updated: ThemeProvider to support 'light' and 'dark' mode switching
Impact: All components using theme tokens will now support dark mode
```

**Why Essential**: Theme system changes affect the entire application's appearance and behavior.

---

**Scenario B (Optional)**: You adjust the padding of a single button component from 8px to 12px.

**What NOT to Log**:
```
❌ Modified: Button.tsx padding from 8px to 12px for better visual balance
```

**Why Optional**: Minor styling tweaks to individual components are typically part of larger feature work. Log the feature (Essential), not every CSS adjustment.

**Exception (Contextual)**: If the padding change was the result of accessibility research showing the button was too small for touch targets:
```
✅ Modified: Button.tsx padding increased from 8px to 12px
Context: Accessibility audit revealed buttons failed WCAG 2.1 minimum touch target size (44x44px)
Research: Analyzed Material Design and iOS HIG touch target guidelines
```

---

#### Example 5: State Management Implementation (Essential)

**Scenario**: You implement Redux store setup for user authentication state.

**Why Essential**: State management architecture is a fundamental system change affecting how data flows through the application.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /frontend/src/store/authSlice.ts
Purpose: Redux slice for authentication state management
State: user (object), isAuthenticated (boolean), loading (boolean), error (string)
Actions: login, logout, refreshToken, updateUser
Integration: Connected to /frontend/src/App.tsx and /frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: Redux Toolkit documentation for createSlice API
❌ Read: existing /frontend/src/store/index.ts to understand store configuration
❌ Searched codebase for existing Redux patterns
❌ Verified actions dispatch correctly in Redux DevTools
```

**Why**: Documentation reading, exploring existing code, and routine testing are standard development activities.

---

### Backend Developer

Backend developers work with APIs, databases, business logic, and server-side integrations. Here are concrete examples of how to apply the logging framework to typical backend actions:

#### Example 1: Creating a New API Endpoint (Essential)

**Scenario**: You create a new REST API endpoint for retrieving user profile data.

**Why Essential**: New API endpoints expand the application's capabilities and represent a public contract with frontend clients. This is a fundamental system change.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /backend/api/views/user_profile.py - UserProfileViewSet
Endpoints:
  - GET /api/v1/users/{id}/profile - Retrieve user profile
  - PUT /api/v1/users/{id}/profile - Update user profile
  - PATCH /api/v1/users/{id}/profile - Partial update
Authentication: Requires JWT token, user can only access/modify own profile or admin
Response format: UserProfileSerializer with fields: bio, avatar_url, social_links, preferences
Rate limit: 100 requests/hour per user
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: /backend/api/views/base.py to understand ViewSet base class
❌ Read: /backend/api/serializers/user.py to check existing user serializers
❌ Checked Django REST Framework documentation for ViewSet methods
❌ Tested endpoint with Postman to verify responses
```

**Why**: Reading existing code, checking documentation, and routine testing are standard development steps.

---

#### Example 2: Database Schema Migration (Essential)

**Scenario**: You add a new UserPreferences table to store user settings.

**Why Essential**: Database schema changes are irreversible infrastructure modifications that affect data storage and must be carefully tracked.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /backend/migrations/0042_add_user_preferences.py
Added table: UserPreferences
Fields:
  - user (ForeignKey to User, one-to-one)
  - theme (CharField: 'light'/'dark', default='light')
  - notifications_enabled (BooleanField, default=True)
  - language (CharField, default='en')
  - timezone (CharField, default='UTC')
Indexes: user_id (unique), created_at
Migration: Applied successfully to development database
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: /backend/models/user.py to understand User model structure
❌ Read: Django documentation for creating migrations
❌ Ran makemigrations command to generate migration file
❌ Verified migration with sqlmigrate to review SQL
```

**Why**: Reading models, checking documentation, and using standard migration tools are routine processes.

---

#### Example 3: Investigating Database Query Performance (Contextual)

**Scenario**: You discover a N+1 query problem in the user profile endpoint causing slow response times, leading you to implement select_related optimization.

**Why Contextual**: The investigation revealed a non-obvious performance issue that influenced your implementation approach. This provides valuable context for understanding why optimizations were needed.

**What to Log**:
```
Investigation: Analyzed slow response times for GET /api/v1/users/{id}/profile (3000ms average)
Finding: N+1 query problem - endpoint making 50+ database queries per request
Root cause: UserProfile references User, Organization, and SocialLinks without select_related
Analysis: Profiled with Django Debug Toolbar, identified 3 related models being queried in loop
Solution: Added select_related('user', 'organization') and prefetch_related('social_links')
Result: Reduced queries from 50+ to 4, response time now 180ms average
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: views/user_profile.py to understand current query implementation
❌ Installed Django Debug Toolbar for query profiling
❌ Read Django ORM documentation for select_related usage
❌ Tested endpoint 10 times to verify consistent performance improvement
```

**Why**: Reading code, installing debugging tools, checking documentation, and routine testing are standard investigation steps. Log the findings and solution, not every step of the process.

---

#### Example 4: Implementing Business Logic (Essential)

**Scenario**: You implement a new email verification workflow for user registration.

**Why Essential**: New business logic that changes how the system behaves must be logged.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /backend/services/email_verification.py - EmailVerificationService
Purpose: Handles email verification token generation, validation, and user account activation
Methods:
  - generate_verification_token(user) -> str
  - send_verification_email(user, token) -> bool
  - verify_token(token) -> User | None
  - activate_user_account(user) -> bool
Token: 32-char random token, expires in 24 hours, stored in Redis
Integration: Called from user registration endpoint, email templates in /templates/email/
Security: Tokens hashed before storage, rate-limited to 3 emails per hour per user
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: existing authentication code to understand patterns
❌ Researched token generation approaches
❌ Read documentation for Redis token storage
❌ Tested verification flow end-to-end 5 times
```

**Why**: Research, documentation reading, and testing are standard development activities.

---

#### Example 5: Adding API Input Validation (Essential)

**Scenario**: You add comprehensive validation to the user profile update endpoint to prevent invalid data.

**Why Essential**: Validation rules are part of the API contract and affect system behavior. Changes to validation must be logged.

**What to Log**:
```
Modified: /backend/api/serializers/user_profile.py - UserProfileSerializer
Added validation:
  - bio: max_length=500, no HTML tags (sanitized)
  - avatar_url: valid URL format, HTTPS only, max 2048 chars
  - social_links: max 5 links, each URL validated, domain whitelist
  - preferences.theme: must be 'light' or 'dark'
Error responses: Returns 400 with detailed field-level error messages
Security: Input sanitization prevents XSS, URL validation prevents SSRF
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: serializers documentation for validation methods
❌ Read: existing validation patterns in other serializers
❌ Tested validation with invalid inputs to verify error messages
❌ Checked OWASP guidelines for input validation best practices
```

**Why**: Documentation reading and routine testing are standard development activities.

---

### DevOps Engineer

DevOps engineers work with infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and system reliability. Here are concrete examples of how to apply the logging framework to typical DevOps actions:

#### Example 1: Updating CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (Essential)

**Scenario**: You add automated security scanning to the CI/CD pipeline using Trivy.

**Why Essential**: CI/CD pipeline changes affect how code is built, tested, and deployed. This is a fundamental infrastructure change.

**What to Log**:
```
Modified: /.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
Added job: security-scan (runs after build, before deploy)
Tool: Trivy container image vulnerability scanner
Configuration:
  - Scans Docker images for CVEs in dependencies and base images
  - Fails pipeline if HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities found
  - Uploads results to GitHub Security tab
  - Runs on: all PRs, main branch pushes
Integration: Blocks deployment if security issues detected
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml to understand current pipeline structure
❌ Read: Trivy documentation for GitHub Actions integration
❌ Searched for example Trivy configurations in other repositories

```

**Why**: Reading current config, documentation, and testing are standard DevOps workflow steps.

---

#### Example 2: Container Orchestration Update (Essential)

**Scenario**: You update the Docker Compose configuration to add Redis for caching.

**Why Essential**: Infrastructure changes that add new services fundamentally change the application's architecture and deployment.

**What to Log**:
```
Modified: /docker-compose.yml
Added service: redis
Configuration:
  - Image: redis:7-alpine
  - Port: 6379 (internal only, not exposed to host)
  - Volume: ./data/redis for persistence
  - Health check: redis-cli ping every 10s
  - Memory limit: 512MB
  - Restart policy: unless-stopped
Integration:
  - Backend service now depends_on redis with condition: service_healthy
  - Environment variable REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379 added to backend
Purpose: Session storage, API response caching, Celery task queue broker
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: docker-compose.yml to understand current services
❌ Read: Redis Docker Hub documentation for configuration options
❌ Tested Redis connection from backend container with redis-cli
❌ Verified Redis persistence with container restart
```

**Why**: Reading configuration, documentation, and routine testing are standard steps.

---

#### Example 3: Investigating Deployment Failure (Contextual)

**Scenario**: Deployment to staging fails due to database connection timeout. You investigate and discover the issue is firewall rules, not application configuration.

**Why Contextual**: The investigation revealed a non-obvious infrastructure issue that explains why the deployment failed and how it was resolved. This provides valuable debugging context.

**What to Log**:
```
Investigation: Staging deployment failing with "database connection timeout" error
Initial hypothesis: Database credentials incorrect or database service down
Findings:
  - Database credentials verified correct in environment variables
  - Database service running and healthy (confirmed via db health check endpoint)
  - Network connectivity test from app container to db container: connection refused
  - Firewall logs showed port 5432 blocked for app container IP range
Root cause: Recent security policy update restricted database access to specific IP ranges, new staging environment IP not whitelisted
Solution: Added staging app container IP range (10.0.2.0/24) to database firewall whitelist
Verification: Deployment succeeded after firewall rule update
Prevention: Documented IP whitelist requirement in deployment runbook
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: deployment logs to identify error message
❌ SSH'd into server to check container status
❌ Ran docker ps to verify containers running
❌ Checked database documentation for connection troubleshooting
❌ Tested database connection with psql client 5 times
```

**Why**: Reading logs, connecting to servers, checking status, and routine troubleshooting steps are standard investigation activities. Log the findings and resolution, not every command you ran.

---

#### Example 4: Deployment Script Creation (Essential)

**Scenario**: You create an automated deployment script for zero-downtime rolling updates.

**Why Essential**: Deployment automation fundamentally changes how releases are performed and must be documented.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /scripts/deploy-rolling-update.sh
Purpose: Zero-downtime rolling deployment for production environment
Process:
  1. Pull latest Docker images from registry
  2. Health check existing containers
  3. Start new containers with updated images
  4. Wait for new containers to pass health checks (max 60s)
  5. Gradually shift traffic from old to new containers (10% increments)
  6. Stop old containers after 100% traffic shifted
  7. Cleanup old images and volumes
Configuration:
  - Environment: production only (staging uses simple docker-compose up)
  - Health check endpoint: /health
  - Rollback: Automatic if new containers fail health check 3 times
  - Notifications: Slack webhook on success/failure
Safety: Creates backup of current containers before deployment, can rollback with --rollback flag
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: existing deployment scripts to understand current process
❌ Researched Docker container rolling update strategies
❌ Read documentation for docker-compose up scaling options
❌ Tested script on staging environment 3 times
```

**Why**: Research, documentation reading, and testing are standard development activities.

---

#### Example 5: Monitoring and Alerting Configuration (Essential)

**Why Essential**: Monitoring infrastructure is a critical system component that affects operational visibility.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /monitoring/prometheus.yml - Prometheus monitoring configuration
Created: /monitoring/dashboards/application-metrics.json - Grafana dashboard
Metrics collected:
  - HTTP request rate, latency (p50, p95, p99), error rate per endpoint
  - Database query performance, connection pool usage
  - Redis cache hit/miss ratio, memory usage
  - Container CPU, memory, disk usage per service
  - Custom business metrics: user registrations, API calls per user
Alerts configured:
  - Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes -> PagerDuty critical
  - Response latency p95 > 1000ms for 10 minutes -> Slack warning
  - Database connection pool > 80% for 5 minutes -> Slack warning
  - Container memory > 90% for 5 minutes -> PagerDuty warning
Dashboards: Application Overview, Database Performance, Infrastructure Health
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: Prometheus documentation for configuration syntax
❌ Read: existing monitoring setup to understand current metrics
❌ Tested Prometheus scraping endpoints to verify metrics collection
❌ Created multiple dashboard iterations before final version
```

**Why**: Documentation reading, exploring existing setup, and iteration are standard activities.

---

### UI/UX Designer

UI/UX designers work with design systems, user research, wireframes, and design documentation. Here are concrete examples of how to apply the logging framework to typical design actions:

#### Example 1: Creating Design Brief (Essential)

**Scenario**: You create a design brief for a new user onboarding flow feature.

**Why Essential**: Design briefs define product requirements and user experience goals, fundamentally shaping what will be built.

**What to Log**:

Scope:
  - Account creation flow (email/password, OAuth providers)
  - Email verification step
  - Profile setup (avatar, bio, preferences)
  - Interactive product tour (5 key features)
  - First task creation assistance
Goals:
  - Reduce time-to-first-value from 15 minutes to < 5 minutes
  - Increase activation rate (user completing first task) from 40% to 65%
  - Support mobile and desktop experiences equally
User research insights:
  - 60% of users abandon during profile setup (too many fields)
  - Users don't understand product value until creating first task
  - Existing onboarding lacks visual guidance and progress indication
Success metrics: Activation rate, time-to-first-task, onboarding completion rate
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: existing design briefs to understand format
❌ Reviewed competitor onboarding flows for inspiration
❌ Met with product team to discuss requirements (routine planning)
```

**Why**: Reading templates, competitive research (unless findings are documented separately as Contextual), and routine meetings are standard design activities.

---

#### Example 2: Wireframe Creation (Essential)

**Scenario**: You create wireframes for the redesigned user profile page.

**Why Essential**: Wireframes define the structure and layout of new or updated interfaces, directly influencing what developers will build.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /design/wireframes/user-profile-redesign/ (Figma file)
Screens designed:
  - Profile overview (desktop and mobile responsive layouts)
  - Edit profile modal
  - Privacy settings panel
  - Activity timeline view
Key design decisions:
  - Card-based layout for better information hierarchy
  - Sticky header with avatar and quick actions
  - Tabbed interface for profile sections (About, Activity, Settings)
  - Inline editing for profile fields (no separate edit page)
Components: Uses existing design system components (Cards, Tabs, Forms, Buttons)
Accessibility: Keyboard navigation support, ARIA labels documented
Handoff: Annotated with spacing, typography, and interaction notes for developers
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: existing profile page designs to understand current layout
❌ Reviewed Material Design guidelines for card layouts
❌ Created 3 alternative layouts before settling on final design
❌ Iterated on mobile layout 4 times to optimize for small screens
```

**Why**: Research, exploring alternatives, and iteration are standard design process activities. Log the final wireframes and decisions, not every iteration step.

---

#### Example 3: User Research Findings That Changed Approach (Contextual)

**Scenario**: You conduct user interviews about the checkout flow and discover users are confused by the payment method selection, leading you to redesign that specific step.

**Why Contextual**: Research findings that reveal user pain points and influence design decisions provide valuable context for understanding why certain design choices were made.

**What to Log**:
```
Research: User interviews on checkout flow (8 participants, 45 min each)
Key finding: 6 out of 8 users struggled to understand payment method options
Observations:
  - Users didn't recognize "Stripe" as credit card payment option
  - Confusion between "Save card" and "Use saved card" options
  - 3 users abandoned checkout thinking only PayPal was available
  - Average time on payment method screen: 2.5 minutes (should be < 30 seconds)
Root cause: Payment method labels prioritize technical names over user-friendly descriptions
Decision: Redesign payment method selection with:
  - Clear visual icons for each payment type (credit card icon, PayPal logo)
  - User-friendly labels: "Credit or Debit Card" instead of "Stripe"
  - Simplified saved card UI with last 4 digits and expiry date visible
  - Visual hierarchy emphasizing most common payment method (credit card)
Expected impact: Reduce payment method selection time and checkout abandonment
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Recruited 8 participants from user research panel
❌ Scheduled interviews across 2 weeks
❌ Created interview script with 12 questions
❌ Took notes during each interview
❌ Synthesized notes into findings document
```

**Why**: Research logistics and process steps are standard user research activities. Log the findings and how they influenced design decisions, not the research process itself.

---

#### Example 4: Design System Documentation Update (Essential)

**Scenario**: You add a new Alert component to the design system with usage guidelines.

**Why Essential**: Design system updates define reusable components that affect consistency across the entire application.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /design/design-system/components/alert.md
Added: Alert component to design system with 4 variants
Variants:
  - Info (blue, informational icon)
  - Success (green, checkmark icon)
  - Warning (yellow, warning icon)
  - Error (red, error icon)
Usage guidelines:
  - Use Info for helpful tips and non-critical information
  - Use Success for confirmation messages and completed actions
  - Use Warning for cautionary messages requiring user awareness
  - Use Error for failures, validation errors, critical issues
Design specs:
  - Padding: 16px vertical, 20px horizontal
  - Border radius: 8px
  - Icon size: 20x20px, positioned 20px from left edge
  - Typography: 14px regular for body, 14px semibold for title (optional)
  - Close button: Optional, positioned top-right
Accessibility: ARIA role="alert" for Error/Warning, role="status" for Info/Success
Implementation: Component available in Figma library and React component library
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: existing design system documentation structure
❌ Reviewed other design systems (Material Design, Ant Design) for alert patterns
❌ Created 5 iterations of alert designs before final version
❌ Gathered feedback from 3 designers on Slack
```

**Why**: Research, iteration, and gathering informal feedback are standard design activities.

---

#### Example 5: Accessibility Guidelines Update (Essential)

**Scenario**: You document keyboard navigation requirements for interactive components following WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

**Why Essential**: Accessibility guidelines define requirements that affect how all interactive components must be built, ensuring the application is usable by everyone.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: /design/accessibility/keyboard-navigation.md
Purpose: Define keyboard navigation requirements for all interactive components (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
Requirements:
  - Tab order: All interactive elements reachable via Tab key in logical order
  - Focus indicators: Visible focus ring (2px solid, primary color, 2px offset) on all focusable elements
  - Skip links: "Skip to main content" link at top of page (visible on focus)
  - Dialogs/modals: Trap focus within dialog, Esc key closes, focus returns to trigger element
  - Dropdowns: Arrow keys navigate options, Enter/Space selects, Esc closes
  - Forms: Tab between fields, Enter submits, error messages announced to screen readers
Component-specific patterns:
  - Tabs: Arrow keys switch tabs, Tab moves to tab panel
  - Accordions: Arrow keys navigate headers, Enter/Space toggles, Home/End to first/last
  - Data tables: Arrow keys navigate cells, actionable cells focusable
Testing: All keyboard patterns tested with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
Documentation: Annotated in Figma wireframes and component specifications for developers
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: WCAG 2.1 documentation for keyboard requirements
❌ Tested keyboard navigation on competitor websites
❌ Reviewed existing components to identify accessibility gaps
❌ Consulted with accessibility expert for best practices
```

**Why**: Research, testing competitors, and consulting experts are standard design activities. Log the guidelines and requirements, not the research process.

---

### Product Owner

Product owners work with requirements, user stories, feature prioritization, and stakeholder management. Here are concrete examples of how to apply the logging framework to typical product owner actions:

#### Example 1: User Story Creation (Essential)

**Scenario**: You create a detailed user story for implementing two-factor authentication.

**Why Essential**: User stories define product requirements and features that development teams will implement. They fundamentally shape what gets built.

**What to Log**:
```
Created: User Story #247 - Two-Factor Authentication
As a security-conscious user, I want to enable two-factor authentication on my account so that my data remains secure even if my password is compromised.

Acceptance Criteria:
  1. User can enable 2FA from account settings using TOTP (authenticator app)
  2. User must verify 2FA setup by entering code before it's activated
  3. User can generate and download backup codes (10 codes) for account recovery
  4. User must enter 2FA code at login after enabling 2FA
  5. User can disable 2FA (requires current password + 2FA code)
  6. System prompts users to enable 2FA after account creation (skippable)

User value: Enhanced account security, peace of mind, compliance with security best practices
Technical considerations: Use TOTP standard (compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)
Dependencies: None (can implement independently)
Priority: High (security feature requested by 40% of survey respondents)
Estimated effort: 8 story points (backend 5 SP, frontend 3 SP)
Success metrics: 30% of active users enable 2FA within 3 months of launch
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: existing user stories to understand format
❌ Reviewed competitor apps to see how they implement 2FA
❌ Met with security team to discuss 2FA requirements (routine consultation)
❌ Reviewed user survey results showing 2FA demand
```

**Why**: Reading templates, competitive research (unless findings are documented separately), and routine consultations are standard product activities.

---

#### Example 2: Feature Prioritization Decision (Essential)

**Scenario**: You reprioritize the product backlog, moving the analytics dashboard ahead of social sharing features based on stakeholder feedback and business metrics.

**Why Essential**: Prioritization decisions directly impact what gets built and when, fundamentally shaping the product roadmap.

**What to Log**:
```
Updated: Product backlog prioritization (Q1 2025 roadmap)
Change: Moved "Analytics Dashboard" feature from Q2 to Q1, ahead of "Social Sharing Features"

New Q1 priorities:
  1. Two-Factor Authentication (security)
  2. Analytics Dashboard (business intelligence) - MOVED UP
  3. Performance Optimization (technical debt)

Moved to Q2:
  - Social Sharing Features (user engagement) - MOVED DOWN

Rationale:
  - Enterprise customers (60% of revenue) requesting analytics dashboard urgently
  - 3 potential enterprise deals blocked pending analytics features ($120K ARR)
  - Social sharing has low adoption in user research (15% of users share content)
  - Analytics provides direct revenue impact; social sharing speculative growth
  - Engineering capacity unchanged; must make trade-off decision

Stakeholder input:
  - Sales team: Analytics critical for closing enterprise deals
  - Marketing team: Social sharing nice-to-have, not urgent
  - CEO: Prioritize revenue-generating features in Q1

Impact: Expected to unblock 3 enterprise deals, estimated $120K ARR in Q1
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Read: current backlog to review priorities
❌ Scheduled meetings with stakeholders to gather input (routine)
❌ Reviewed revenue data to assess enterprise customer impact
❌ Created prioritization matrix comparing features
```

**Why**: Reading backlog, meeting with stakeholders, analyzing data, and using prioritization frameworks are standard product activities.

#### Example 3: Requirements Clarification After Stakeholder Feedback (Contextual)

**Scenario**: After demoing the user profile redesign prototype to stakeholders, you receive critical feedback that the privacy controls are insufficient. This leads you to add new requirements to the user story.

**Why Contextual**: Stakeholder feedback that significantly changes requirements provides valuable context for understanding why requirements evolved and how decisions were made.

**What to Log**:
```
Updated: User Story #198 - User Profile Redesign (requirements change)
Stakeholder feedback: Demo with Legal and Compliance teams revealed privacy control gaps

New requirements added:
  1. Granular privacy controls for each profile field (public/connections-only/private)
  2. Default privacy: All fields private for new users (opt-in sharing, not opt-out)
  3. Privacy policy link visible on profile edit screen
  4. Audit log showing when privacy settings were changed (compliance requirement)

Context:
  - Original story assumed profile fields would be public by default (standard social pattern)
  - Legal team raised GDPR compliance concerns about default-public personal data
  - Compliance team requires audit trail for privacy changes (regulatory requirement)
  - Stakeholders emphasized: Privacy controls must be obvious and easy to use

Impact:
  - Effort estimate increased from 5 SP to 8 SP (additional privacy UI + audit logging)
  - Timeline: Moved from current sprint to next sprint (needs additional design work)
  - Design team creating new privacy control UI (radio buttons for each field)

Decision: Delay feature by 1 sprint to implement comprehensive privacy controls rather than ship with insufficient privacy and retrofit later
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Scheduled demo with Legal and Compliance teams
❌ Prepared demo presentation slides
❌ Took notes during stakeholder feedback session
❌ Met with development team to discuss effort increase
```

**Why**: Scheduling demos, preparing materials, taking notes, and consulting with the team are standard product activities. Log the feedback, requirement changes, and decisions, not the process.

#### Example 4: Competitive Analysis Findings (Contextual)

**Scenario**: You analyze 5 competitor products' onboarding flows and discover a pattern that influences your product strategy.

**Why Contextual**: Competitive analysis findings that reveal market patterns and influence product decisions provide valuable context for understanding strategic choices.

**What to Log**:
```
Research: Competitive analysis of onboarding flows (5 products: Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Notion, Trello)
Key findings:
  - All 5 competitors use template-based onboarding (pre-built project templates)
  - 4 out of 5 offer personalized template recommendations based on team size/industry
  - Average time-to-first-value: 3-5 minutes (our product: 15 minutes)
  - Common pattern: Skip detailed profile setup, focus on creating first project/task immediately
  - Success metric trend: Products emphasizing templates have 70%+ activation rates (ours: 40%)

Pattern identified: Template-based onboarding reduces decision paralysis and accelerates value realization

Strategic implication:
  - Our current onboarding forces users to start from blank slate (high cognitive load)
  - Industry standard is now template-first onboarding
  - Users expect template recommendations, not empty workspace

Decision: Add epic to Q1 roadmap for template-based onboarding system
  - Epic: "Template Library & Smart Recommendations"
  - Includes: 15-20 pre-built templates, recommendation engine, template preview
  - Expected impact: Increase activation rate from 40% to 65%, reduce time-to-first-value from 15 min to 5 min

Trade-off: Deprioritizing social sharing features to accommodate template system in Q1
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Signed up for competitor products to test onboarding
❌ Took screenshots of each competitor's onboarding flow
❌ Created comparison spreadsheet with 20+ data points
❌ Timed each onboarding flow with stopwatch
❌ Synthesized notes into findings document
```

**Why**: Research process steps are standard competitive analysis activities. Log the findings, patterns, and strategic decisions, not every research step.

#### Example 5: Acceptance Criteria Refinement (Essential)

**Scenario**: During sprint planning, you refine the acceptance criteria for a complex user story based on technical feasibility discussions with the development team.

**Why Essential**: Acceptance criteria define the specific requirements for feature completion and directly impact what gets built and how success is measured.

**What to Log**:
```
Updated: User Story #312 - Real-Time Collaboration (acceptance criteria refinement)
Change: Adjusted acceptance criteria based on technical feasibility discussion with engineering team

Original AC #4 (removed):
  ❌ "All users see changes from other users within 100ms (real-time)"

New AC #4 (added):
  ✅ "All users see changes from other users within 1-2 seconds (near-real-time)"

Rationale:
  - Engineering team explained: True 100ms real-time requires WebSocket infrastructure we don't have
  - WebSocket setup estimated at 13 SP (2+ sprints) vs 5 SP for polling approach (current sprint)
  - User research shows: Users perceive < 2 second updates as "real-time" (no noticeable delay)
  - Polling approach (2-second interval) provides 95% of user value at 30% of implementation cost

Decision: Accept near-real-time (1-2s) instead of true real-time (100ms)
  - Delivers core collaboration value in current sprint
  - Avoids 2-sprint delay for WebSocket infrastructure
  - User experience impact minimal (research validated)
  - Can upgrade to true real-time in future if user feedback indicates need

Impact: Feature ships in current sprint instead of delayed 2 sprints
Success metrics unchanged: Collaboration feature adoption rate target remains 50% of active users
```

**What NOT to Log** (Optional):
```
❌ Met with engineering team in sprint planning (routine)
❌ Discussed WebSocket vs polling trade-offs for 30 minutes
❌ Reviewed user research notes on real-time perception
❌ Consulted with UX designer on acceptable update latency
```

**Why**: Sprint planning discussions, reviewing research, and consulting team members are standard product activities. Log the acceptance criteria changes and rationale, not the meeting process.

## Summary: Agent-Specific Logging Patterns

Each agent role has distinct work patterns, but all apply the same three-tier framework:

**Essential Logging** (always log):
- Any action that changes the system, defines requirements, or creates artifacts
- Frontend: Components, routes, state management, theme changes
- Backend: API endpoints, database schemas, business logic, integrations
- DevOps: Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployments, monitoring
- UI/UX: Design briefs, wireframes, design system, accessibility guidelines
- Product: User stories, prioritization decisions, acceptance criteria

**Contextual Logging** (log when adds value):
- Investigations, research findings, and decisions that influenced implementation
- Frontend: Performance analysis, accessibility research, design pattern decisions
- Backend: Query optimization findings, architecture decisions, security analysis
- DevOps: Deployment troubleshooting, infrastructure scaling decisions, alert threshold rationale
- UI/UX: User research insights, design decision rationale, accessibility findings
- Product: Competitive analysis, stakeholder feedback impact, requirement changes

**Optional Logging** (skip unless exceptional):
- Routine preparation, exploration, documentation reading, standard testing
- Frontend: Reading components, checking docs, testing in browser, minor CSS tweaks
- Backend: Reading models, checking docs, routine testing, standard CRUD
- DevOps: Checking status, reading configs, routine verification, testing scripts
- UI/UX: Reading templates, iteration steps, informal feedback, research logistics
- Product: Reading backlog, routine meetings, creating frameworks, process steps

The key principle: **Log what you built and why, not how you built it** (unless the "how" provides exceptional value).
