# Issue #232: CI/CD Pipeline Failed - Code Quality (Line Length Violation)

**Feature**: 15 - Phase 1: Consolidate Docker Compose Files
**Branch**: feature/15-consolidate-docker-compose-files
**Issue Type**: Fix
**Created**: 2025-10-27

## Issue Summary

The CI/CD pipeline is blocked due to a code quality violation - a comment line in the backend configuration views exceeds the project's 100-character line length limit enforced by flake8. While all tests pass successfully, the linting check prevents the build from completing and blocks the feature branch from being merged.

## Root Cause Analysis

- **What Failed**: Backend code linting check
- **Why**: Line 89 in `/backend/apps/api/config_views.py` contains a comment that is 102 characters long, exceeding the flake8 E501 rule (maximum 100 characters)
- **Impact**: Entire CI/CD pipeline cannot proceed to deployment stages, blocking merge to main branch

### Story 15-Fix-232.1: Fix Comment Line Length Violation

**As a** developer preparing code for merge
**I want** all code to comply with the project's line length standards
**So that** the CI/CD pipeline can complete successfully and code quality standards are maintained

**Description**:
The configuration views file contains a comment that exceeds the maximum allowed line length. The comment on line 89 needs to be reformatted to comply with the project's 100-character limit while preserving its meaning and readability.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I run the flake8 linter on the backend codebase, when it checks `/backend/apps/api/config_views.py`, then there should be no E501 line length violations
- Given the comment on line 89 describes the FRONTEND_API_URL default behavior, when I read the reformatted comment, then it should convey the same information clearly
- Given I commit the fix, when the CI/CD pipeline runs, then the "Build and Test Complete Stack" job should pass the backend linting step
- Given the linting passes, when the complete pipeline runs, then all stages should complete successfully without errors
