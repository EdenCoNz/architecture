# Docker Compose Consolidation - Team Announcement

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Complete
**Impact:** All team members
**Action Required:** Update local development environments

---

## What Changed

We have completed **Phase 1 of the Docker Simplification initiative (Feature #15)**, which consolidates our Docker Compose files into a simplified, non-redundant structure. This change reduces configuration complexity and establishes a single source of truth for container orchestration.

### Files Removed

The following Docker Compose files have been **removed** from the repository:

**Root Directory:**
- ❌ `docker-compose.unified.yml` - Was a duplicate of `docker-compose.yml`

**Backend Directory:**
- ❌ `backend/docker-compose.yml` - Backend services now defined in root compose files
- ❌ `backend/docker-compose.production.yml` - Production config consolidated into root `compose.production.yml`

**Frontend Directory:**
- ❌ `frontend/docker-compose.yml` - Frontend service now defined in root compose files
- ❌ `frontend/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production config consolidated into root `compose.production.yml`

### Files That Remain

The following Docker Compose files are now the **canonical configuration** for all environments:

**Root Directory (all commands run from project root):**
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Base orchestration for all services and environments
- ✅ `compose.override.yml` - Local development overrides (automatically loaded)
- ✅ `compose.production.yml` - Production environment overrides
- ✅ `compose.staging.yml` - Staging environment overrides
- ✅ `compose.test.yml` - Test environment

**Total Reduction:** 10 compose files → 5 compose files (50% reduction)

---

## Why This Change Was Made

**Problems Solved:**
1. **Eliminated Duplication:** No more confusion about which compose file to use
2. **Single Source of Truth:** All service definitions in one place
3. **Consistent Patterns:** Same structure for all environments
4. **Reduced Maintenance:** Fewer files to keep in sync
5. **Improved Onboarding:** Clearer structure for new team members

**Benefits:**
- Faster development setup
- Easier troubleshooting
- Consistent behavior across environments
- Better alignment with Docker Compose best practices
- Foundation for future simplification phases

---

## Migration Steps

### For Local Development Environments

**Step 1: Pull Latest Changes**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**Step 2: Clean Up Existing Containers**
```bash
# Stop all running containers and remove volumes
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

**Step 3: Verify Configuration**
```bash
# Validate the consolidated compose files
docker compose config --quiet

# Should complete without errors
```

**Step 4: Start Services with New Configuration**
```bash
# Using the helper script (recommended)
./docker-dev.sh start

# Or directly with docker compose
docker compose up -d

# Check service health
./docker-dev.sh status
# Or: docker compose ps
```

**Step 5: Verify Application Works**
```bash
# Frontend should be accessible
open http://localhost/

# Backend API should respond
curl http://localhost/api/v1/health/

# All services should show as "healthy"
docker compose ps
```

### For CI/CD and Automation

**No Action Required:** CI/CD workflows have already been updated to use the consolidated compose files. All automated deployments will continue to work without changes.

### For Staging/Production Deployments

**Commands Updated:** The deployment commands remain the same, but now use the consolidated files:

```bash
# Staging deployment
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f compose.staging.yml up -d

# Production deployment
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f compose.production.yml up -d

# Test environment
docker compose -f compose.test.yml up -d
```

---

## What to Use Going Forward

### Local Development

**Recommended (uses helper script):**
```bash
./docker-dev.sh start          # Start all services
./docker-dev.sh stop           # Stop all services
./docker-dev.sh restart        # Restart all services
./docker-dev.sh status         # Check service health
./docker-dev.sh logs [service] # View logs
./docker-dev.sh shell [service] # Access service shell
```

**Direct Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker compose up              # Start with automatic override
docker compose down            # Stop services
docker compose ps              # Check status
docker compose logs -f         # Follow logs
```

### Environment-Specific Commands

**Local (Development):**
```bash
docker compose up
# Automatically uses: docker-compose.yml + compose.override.yml
```

**Staging:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f compose.staging.yml up
```

**Production:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f compose.production.yml up
```

**Testing:**
```bash
docker compose -f compose.test.yml up
```

### With Celery Background Workers

**Local with Celery:**
```bash
docker compose --profile with-celery up
```

**Staging with Celery:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f compose.staging.yml --profile with-celery up
```

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue 1: Services fail to start**
```bash
# Solution: Clean up completely and start fresh
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker compose up
```

**Issue 2: Port conflicts**
```bash
# Solution: Check for existing containers
docker ps -a

# Stop all containers
docker compose down

# Verify ports are free
lsof -i :80 -i :5173 -i :8000 -i :5432 -i :6379
```

**Issue 3: Old configuration cached**
```bash
# Solution: Remove old containers and images
docker compose down --rmi local -v
docker compose up --build
```

**Issue 4: "file not found" errors**
```bash
# Solution: Ensure you're running from project root
cd /path/to/architecture
docker compose up
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues after migration:

**1. Check Updated Documentation**
   - Read GETTING_STARTED.md for complete setup guide
   - Check docs/DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for common issues

**2. Access Backup Configuration (if needed)**

   The previous configuration is preserved in two locations:

   **Git Branch Backup:**
   ```bash
   # Switch to backup branch
   git checkout backup/pre-docker-simplification-phase1

   # Use old configuration temporarily
   docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up

   # Return to main branch when ready
   git checkout main
   ```

   **Local Filesystem Backup:**
   ```bash
   # Located at:
   /home/ed/Dev/architecture/backups/docker-config-20251027_071855/

   # Contains all 10 original compose files and 16 environment files
   # See backup README for restoration instructions
   ```

**3. Ask the Team**
   - Post in #development Slack channel
   - Tag @devops-team for urgent issues
   - Include error messages and commands you ran

**4. Report Issues**
   - Create GitHub issue with "docker-compose" label
   - Include steps to reproduce
   - Attach relevant logs

---

## Testing and Validation

All consolidation work has been thoroughly tested:

**✅ Validation Completed:**
- All 5 compose files pass syntax validation
- All services start successfully (database, cache, backend, frontend, proxy, worker)
- All health checks pass within expected timeframes
- Staging configuration validates without errors
- Production configuration validates without errors
- End-to-end functionality verified (frontend, API, database persistence)
- Multi-environment deployments tested

**✅ Zero Breaking Changes:**
- All existing workflows continue to function
- Service behavior unchanged
- API endpoints remain the same
- Database schemas unaffected
- No code changes required

---

## Rollback Procedure

If you need to temporarily revert to the previous configuration:

**Quick Rollback (Git Branch):**
```bash
# 1. Switch to backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-docker-simplification-phase1

# 2. Stop current services
docker compose down -v

# 3. Start with old configuration
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up

# 4. When ready to return
git checkout main
docker compose up
```

**Full Rollback (Local Backup):**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to backup directory
cd /home/ed/Dev/architecture/backups/docker-config-20251027_071855/

# 2. Follow restoration instructions in backup README.md

# 3. Report issue to team so we can help
```

**Important:** The backup branch will be maintained for **30 days** (until 2025-11-26) to allow any unforeseen issues to be addressed.
