## User Stories

### 1. Research and Select Frontend Technology Stack
Conduct research to select the optimal frontend technology stack for a modern web application. Evaluate frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte), build tools (Vite, Webpack), and package managers based on current best practices, performance, and ecosystem maturity.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Technology stack documented with rationale for each choice
- Comparison of at least 3 major frontend frameworks completed
- Build tool and package manager selected with justification

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: none

---

### 2. Initialize Frontend Project with Build Tooling
Create the `frontend/` directory and initialize the project with the selected framework and build tooling. Set up the package manager configuration and install core dependencies.

Acceptance Criteria:
- `frontend/` directory created with initialized project
- Build tool configuration files present and functional
- Core framework dependencies installed and documented in package.json

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: Story #1

---

### 3. Create Project Directory Structure
Establish a scalable and maintainable directory structure following industry best practices. Create folders for components, pages, utilities, assets, and tests with proper organization.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Standard directory structure created (src/, public/, tests/)
- Subdirectories for components, pages, utils, assets, and styles exist
- Index files created where appropriate for clean imports

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: Story #2

---

### 4. Design Foundation and Style System
Create the foundational design system including color palette, typography scale, spacing system, and responsive breakpoints. Document all design tokens and create initial component style guidelines.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Design brief created at docs/design-brief.md with complete design system
- Color palette defined with primary, secondary, and semantic colors
- Typography scale and spacing system documented

Agent: ui-ux-designer
Dependencies: Story #2

**Design Context**:
- Create docs/design-brief.md with the foundational design system
- Include color palette, typography, spacing, and responsive breakpoints
- Add design tokens that can be used for CSS variables or theme configuration
- Document component design principles and accessibility standards

---

### 5. Configure Development Environment
Set up the development environment with hot module replacement, ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript (if applicable). Configure editor settings and code quality tools.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ESLint configuration file present with appropriate rules
- Prettier configuration file present with code formatting rules
- Development server starts successfully with hot reload

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: Story #3

---

### 6. Create Core Application Shell
Build the main application shell including the root App component, global styles, and theme provider. Implement basic layout structure with header and main content areas.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Root App component created with proper structure
- Global styles applied using design system tokens
- Application renders successfully in browser

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: Story #4, Story #5

---

### 7. Implement Basic Routing Configuration
Set up client-side routing with the selected routing library. Create initial routes for home and a placeholder 404 page. Configure routing structure for future page additions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Routing library installed and configured
- Home route and 404 page routes functional
- Navigation between routes works without page reload

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: Story #6

---

### 8. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Frontend
Create GitHub Actions workflow for the frontend application. Configure automated builds, linting, and deployment preparation on pull requests and main branch commits.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GitHub Actions workflow file created for frontend
- Workflow runs build and lint checks on pull requests
- Build artifacts generated successfully in CI environment

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #5

---

### 9. Set Up Testing Infrastructure
Install and configure testing framework (Jest, Vitest, or Testing Library). Create initial test setup files and write example tests for core components.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Testing framework installed and configured
- Test runner executes successfully
- Example test file created and passing

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: Story #6

---

### 10. Create Frontend Documentation
Write comprehensive README.md for the frontend directory. Document installation steps, available scripts, project structure, coding conventions, and contribution guidelines.

Acceptance Criteria:
- README.md created in frontend/ directory
- Installation and setup instructions documented
- All npm/yarn scripts explained with usage examples

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: Story #9
