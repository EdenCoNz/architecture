# User Stories for Issue #202
**Feature**: 11 - Onboarding & Assessment
**Issue**: Workflow Run #75 Failed: Backend CI/CD (0 failure(s))
**Branch**: feature/11-onboarding-assessment
**Created**: 2025-10-25

## Issue Summary
The CI/CD pipeline is failing due to type annotation issues in the assessment module, preventing code quality validation and production deployment. The system's type safety checks are detecting missing type information that could lead to runtime errors, and the API documentation generator cannot properly document endpoints without complete type information.

## Business Impact
- Code quality gates are failing, blocking deployment to production
- Type safety is compromised, increasing risk of runtime errors
- API documentation generation is broken, impacting developer experience
- Production containers cannot start, making the feature non-deployable

## Story 202.1: Fix Type Annotations in Assessment Data Model

**As a** platform operator
**I want** the assessment data model to have complete type information
**So that** the code quality tools can verify type safety and prevent runtime errors

### Description
The assessment data model fields need proper type annotations to satisfy type checking requirements. Currently, seven model fields lack explicit type annotations, causing the type checker to fail validation. This creates a gap in type safety that could allow type-related bugs to reach production.

Type annotations serve as both documentation and validation - they help developers understand what data types are expected and allow automated tools to catch type mismatches before code runs. For the assessment model storing critical user profile data (user reference, sport choice, age, experience level, training frequency, injury status, and equipment availability), complete type information ensures data integrity.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** the type checker runs on the assessment models file, **when** it analyzes field declarations, **then** it should not report any missing type annotation errors
2. **Given** a developer views the assessment model code, **when** they examine field definitions, **then** each field should have clear type information indicating its data structure
3. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline executes type checking, **when** it validates the assessment module, **then** the type check step should pass without errors related to model field annotations
4. **Given** the codebase is analyzed for type safety, **when** examining the assessment model, **then** all seven previously unannotated fields (user, sport, age, experience_level, training_days, injuries, equipment) should have complete type information

### Technical Context
- **File**: backend/apps/assessments/models.py
- **Lines**: 52, 60, 68, 80, 88, 96, 105
- **Error Pattern**: "Need type annotation for [field_name]"
- **Impact**: Blocks CI/CD pipeline, reduces type safety
- **Dependencies**: None

## Story 202.2: Fix API Documentation Generation for Assessment Endpoints

**As a** platform operator
**I want** the assessment API endpoints to be properly documented
**So that** the production container can start successfully and developers can access accurate API documentation

### Description
The API documentation generator needs complete type information to properly document endpoint parameters. Currently, the assessment endpoints lack sufficient type information for the path parameter used to identify specific assessments, causing the documentation generator to fail with warnings that prevent container startup in production mode.

When the documentation system cannot determine parameter types, it cannot generate accurate API documentation showing developers what data types to send and receive. This breaks the automatic API documentation that helps frontend developers integrate with backend services. More critically, the production container treats these documentation warnings as fatal errors and refuses to start, making the application non-deployable.

The endpoint handling needs to provide the documentation system with enough information to understand what type of identifier is used to look up assessment records.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** the production container starts, **when** the Django system performs startup checks, **then** it should not report any warnings about untyped path parameters in the assessment viewset
2. **Given** the API documentation generator analyzes the assessment endpoints, **when** it processes path parameters, **then** it should successfully derive the type of the identifier parameter without defaulting to generic string type
3. **Given** a developer accesses the API documentation, **when** they view assessment endpoint specifications, **then** the path parameters should display accurate type information
4. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline builds the production container, **when** it tests container startup, **then** the container should start successfully without Django system check errors

### Technical Context
- **File**: backend/apps/assessments/views.py
- **Line**: 36
- **Error**: "could not derive type of path parameter 'id' because it is untyped and obtaining queryset from the viewset failed"
- **Impact**: Production container fails to start, API documentation broken
- **Dependencies**: Story 202.1 (type annotations may help with queryset analysis)
- **Documentation System**: DRF Spectacular (OpenAPI schema generator)

## Story 202.3: Fix Method Type Signature Compatibility

**As a** platform operator
**I want** method overrides to maintain type compatibility with their base implementations
**I want** the code to follow proper object-oriented design principles
**So that** the type checker validates architectural soundness and prevents runtime type errors

### Description
When a method overrides a parent class method, it must maintain type compatibility to ensure the subclass can be used anywhere the parent class is expected (Liskov Substitution Principle). Currently, one method override in the assessment view has an incompatible type signature, creating a type safety violation that could cause runtime errors if the wrong type is passed.

The perform_create method override is declaring a more specific parameter type than its parent definition, violating type compatibility rules. While the specific type may work in practice, it breaks the guarantee that this class can substitute for its parent class. Type checkers enforce these rules to catch architectural issues that could cause problems when the code is extended or refactored.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** the type checker validates method overrides, **when** it analyzes the perform_create method, **then** it should not report type compatibility violations
2. **Given** the assessment viewset is used as a substitute for its parent class, **when** code calls the perform_create method, **then** the type system should guarantee type safety
3. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline runs type checking, **when** it validates the views module, **then** it should pass without override compatibility errors
4. **Given** a developer examines the code, **when** they review method signatures, **then** the parameter types should be compatible with parent class definitions

### Technical Context
- **File**: backend/apps/assessments/views.py
- **Line**: 36
- **Error**: "Argument 1 of 'perform_create' is incompatible with supertype 'rest_framework.mixins.CreateModelMixin'"
- **Issue**: Method override violates Liskov substitution principle
- **Impact**: Type checker fails, architectural soundness compromised
- **Dependencies**: None

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Parallel Execution
All three stories can be worked on in parallel as they fix independent type annotation issues in different parts of the codebase:
- Story 202.1 (Model field type annotations)
- Story 202.2 (API documentation path parameter types)
- Story 202.3 (Method signature compatibility)

### Dependencies
While Story 202.1 and 202.2 are listed separately, fixing the model type annotations (202.1) may help the documentation system better analyze the queryset (202.2). However, they can still be implemented independently.

## Success Metrics
- CI/CD pipeline passes all type checking steps
- Production container starts successfully
- Zero mypy type errors in assessment module
- API documentation generates without warnings
- All code quality gates pass

## Notes
- All stories focus on type annotation and type safety improvements
- No functional changes to application behavior
- Changes improve code maintainability and prevent future bugs
- Type safety is a foundational quality attribute that enables confident refactoring
