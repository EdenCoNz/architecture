        "description": "Analyzed the DRF Spectacular documentation generation error",
        "details": "The error 'could not derive type of path parameter id because it is untyped and obtaining queryset from the viewset failed' occurs because the AssessmentViewSet only has a get_queryset() method override without a class-level queryset attribute. DRF Spectacular needs the class-level queryset to introspect the model and determine the type of path parameters (like 'id') for OpenAPI schema generation."

        "description": "Reviewed the Assessment model and viewset structure",
        "details": "Confirmed that Assessment model inherits from TimeStampedModel, which provides standard Django auto-increment integer ID. The viewset uses get_queryset() to filter by authenticated user, which is correct for runtime security but insufficient for schema generation."

This provides DRF Spectacular with the base queryset needed to introspect the model and derive parameter types. The get_queryset() method at runtime will still filter to user-specific assessments, maintaining security.",

          "reasoning": "Class-level queryset is used by DRF Spectacular for schema generation, while get_queryset() method is used at runtime for request filtering. Both can coexist - Django REST Framework uses get_queryset() when it exists, falling back to queryset only if get_queryset() is not defined."

This pattern is documented in DRF and DRF Spectacular, allowing static analysis tools to understand model structure while maintaining dynamic runtime behavior.",

          {
            "alternative": "Use @extend_schema decorator with manual parameter typing",

            "alternative": "Remove get_queryset() override",
            "rejected_because": "Would break security by allowing users to access other users' assessments. The filtered queryset is essential for authorization."

    "notes": [
      "The linter (likely isort or an IDE formatter) automatically added 'from rest_framework.serializers import BaseSerializer' import and changed perform_create parameter type, which resolves Story 202.3 as a side effect",
      "This fix follows Django REST Framework conventions where class-level queryset provides base query for schema generation, and get_queryset() method allows runtime filtering",
      "The Assessment model uses standard Django auto-increment integer primary key (inherited from models.Model), so the 'id' parameter will be documented as type 'integer' in OpenAPI schema",
      "This is the only ModelViewSet in the project (confirmed by grep), so this fix resolves all instances of this issue"
