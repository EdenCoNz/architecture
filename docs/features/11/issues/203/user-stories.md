# Fix Issue #203: Frontend Code Quality Violations

## Overview
The frontend CI/CD pipeline is failing due to code quality violations that prevent the onboarding and assessment feature from being deployed. These violations include formatting inconsistencies (not following Prettier rules) and redundant import statements across multiple component files. All errors are automatically fixable and need to be resolved to restore the deployment pipeline.

## User Stories

### 1. Fix Code Quality Violations in Assessment Components

As a developer, I want all frontend code to pass automated quality checks, so that the CI/CD pipeline can successfully build and deploy the onboarding and assessment feature.

The assessment form components contain formatting violations and duplicate import statements that cause the linting process to fail. These issues prevent code from being merged and deployed, blocking users from accessing the feature.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When I run the linting command, all files should pass without formatting errors
- When I run the linting command, all files should pass without duplicate import violations
- When I push code to the feature branch, the CI/CD pipeline should complete successfully without linting failures
- When I view the affected files, the code should follow consistent formatting standards

## Technical Context for Implementation

The following technical details are provided to help the frontend-developer understand the specific violations:

### Files Affected
1. `frontend/src/components/forms/AssessmentForm.test.tsx`
   - 4 Prettier formatting errors (lines 123-126)
   - Missing proper indentation and line breaks

2. `frontend/src/components/forms/AssessmentForm.tsx`
   - 1 duplicate 'react' import (line 11)

3. `frontend/src/components/forms/AssessmentFormStepper.tsx`
   - 1 duplicate 'react' import (line 11)

4. `frontend/src/pages/Onboarding/Onboarding.tsx`
   - 1 duplicate '../../components/forms' import (line 17)

### Auto-Fix Available
All 7 errors are automatically fixable using ESLint's `--fix` option or by running the project's formatting scripts.

### Verification
After fixes are applied:
- Run linting locally to confirm all errors are resolved
- Push to the feature branch to verify CI/CD passes
- Confirm all 7 errors (4 formatting + 3 duplicate imports) are eliminated
