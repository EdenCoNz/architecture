# Fix User Stories: Issue #224
# CI/CD Pipeline Failed: Build and Test - Run #18

**Feature ID**: 14
**Branch**: feature/14-make-the-onboarding-page-the-main-page
**Issue Number**: #224
**Created**: 2025-10-26

## Issue Overview

The CI/CD pipeline failed due to code formatting and linting errors in test files. ESLint and Prettier detected 8 violations in test files for the Home and About pages, preventing the build from completing and blocking deployment to staging and production.

## Story 14.224.1: Fix Test Code Formatting Violations

**Assigned Agent**: frontend-developer

### Description
As a developer, I need the test files to comply with Prettier formatting standards so that the CI/CD pipeline can complete successfully and the code maintains consistent formatting across the project.

The test files contain long lines in test assertions that need to be properly formatted with line breaks according to the project's Prettier configuration. This prevents the automated build from passing and blocks the feature from being deployed.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have test files with Prettier formatting violations
**When** I run the code quality checks
**Then** all Prettier formatting errors in Home.test.tsx should be resolved
**And** all Prettier formatting errors in About.test.tsx should be resolved
**And** the code should maintain the same test functionality after formatting
**And** running `npm run lint` should report 0 Prettier errors

### Technical Reference
The following files contain Prettier formatting violations:
- `frontend/src/pages/Home/Home.test.tsx`: 4 formatting errors (lines 60, 124, 167, 215)
- `frontend/src/pages/About/About.test.tsx`: 2 formatting errors (lines 30, 40)

All errors can be auto-fixed using ESLint's `--fix` option.

## Story 14.224.2: Remove Unused Variables from Test Files

**Assigned Agent**: frontend-developer

### Description
As a developer, I need to remove unused variables and imports from test files so that the codebase maintains clean, maintainable code and passes ESLint quality checks.

The test files contain unused imports and variable declarations that violate the project's code quality standards. These must be removed to allow the CI/CD pipeline to complete successfully.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have test files with unused variable violations
**When** I run the code quality checks
**Then** the unused 'Home' import should be removed from the test file
**And** the unused 'container' variable declaration should be removed
**And** the tests should continue to function correctly after cleanup
**And** running `npm run lint` should report 0 unused variable errors

### Technical Reference
The following violations exist:
- Unused 'Home' import (line 12) - defined but never used
- Unused 'container' variable (line 307) - assigned a value but never used

Project convention: Allowed unused vars must match `/^_/u` pattern.

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Fix All Code Quality Issues (Parallel)
- Story 14.224.1: Fix Test Code Formatting Violations (frontend-developer)
- Story 14.224.2: Remove Unused Variables from Test Files (frontend-developer)

**Note**: Both stories can be addressed simultaneously as they affect different aspects of code quality in the same files. The developer should apply auto-fix for Prettier formatting, then manually remove unused variables.

## Summary

- **Total Stories**: 2
- **Assigned Agents**: frontend-developer
- **Execution Phases**: 1
- **Parallel Phases**: 1
- **Sequential Phases**: 0

### Story Quality Validation
- All stories are implementation-agnostic
- All stories focus on WHAT needs to be fixed, not HOW
- All acceptance criteria are observable and testable
- No technical implementation details that restrict approach
- Stories work for ANY technology stack

### Atomicity Compliance
- Each story addresses one specific type of violation
- Both stories can be completed in under 1 day
- Each has 3-4 clear acceptance criteria
- No compound titles containing "and"
