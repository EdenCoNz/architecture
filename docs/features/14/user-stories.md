**I want** access to any informational or welcome content that was previously on the home page
**So that** I can learn about the application and its features

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** the previous home page had welcome content or feature information, **when** that content is relocated, **then** it should be accessible from a clearly labeled navigation item or route

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Core Routing Changes (Sequential)

**Stories:** Story-14.1
**Rationale:** The foundation change that makes onboarding the default route must be implemented first

### Phase 2: Compatibility and Navigation Updates (Parallel)

**Stories:** Story-14.2, Story-14.3
**Rationale:** These stories enhance the routing change but can be implemented independently in parallel

### Phase 3: Content Relocation (Sequential)

**Stories:** Story-14.4
**Rationale:** Depends on decisions made during Phase 1 about what to do with existing home page content

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates (Sequential)

**Stories:** Story-14.5
**Rationale:** Documentation should be updated after all functional changes are complete

## Story Quality Metrics

- **Total Stories:** 5
- **Average Acceptance Criteria per Story:** 3.4
- **Stories with Dependencies:** 4
- **Parallel Execution Phases:** 1
- **Sequential Execution Phases:** 3

## Notes

**Design Considerations:**
- No new UI design is required since we're reusing existing onboarding components
- Consider whether a "landing page" with marketing content is needed in the future

**Technical Considerations:**
- Routing changes are straightforward but need testing
- Consider browser history behavior when implementing redirects
- Ensure all E2E tests are updated to reflect new routing structure

**User Impact:**
- Existing users may be surprised if they were accustomed to a different home page
- New users will have a more streamlined onboarding experience
- Users with bookmarks to /onboarding will still reach the correct page

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test direct navigation to root URL
- Test redirect from /onboarding to root URL
- Test navigation menu highlighting
- Update E2E tests for new routing structure
- Test browser back/forward buttons with new routing

## Success Criteria

This feature is considered complete when:

1. Navigating to the root URL displays the onboarding interface
2. The /onboarding route properly redirects to the root URL
3. All navigation elements are updated and consistent
4. Previous home page content is appropriately relocated or removed
5. Documentation reflects the new routing structure
6. All existing functionality works without regression
7. E2E tests pass with updated routing expectations
