### 8. Create API Documentation System
As a developer consuming the API, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I understand available endpoints, request formats, and expected responses.

Establish an API documentation system that describes all endpoints, request parameters, response formats, authentication requirements, and example usage. Make documentation accessible and automatically updated as the API evolves.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When I access the documentation, I should see a list of all available endpoints with descriptions
- When I view an endpoint, I should see required parameters, optional parameters, and expected responses
- When I view an endpoint, I should see example requests and responses
- When the API changes, I should see documentation update automatically or have clear instructions to update it

### 9. Implement Security Best Practices
As a security-conscious stakeholder, I want the API to follow security best practices, so that user data and system integrity are protected.

Configure security headers, request validation, rate limiting, CORS policies, and input sanitization. Protect against common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, CSRF) and implement secure communication practices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When I inspect HTTP responses, I should see security headers configured appropriately
- When I send malformed or malicious input, I should see it rejected with appropriate error messages
- When I make excessive requests, I should encounter rate limiting
- When I attempt cross-origin requests from unauthorized domains, I should see them blocked

## Notes

### Story Quality Validation
- All stories are implementation-agnostic (no specific frameworks mentioned)
- All stories focus on user-observable capabilities and business requirements
- All acceptance criteria describe WHAT needs to be achieved, not HOW
- Stories are atomic and independently valuable
- Each story can be completed in 1-3 days

### Technology Neutrality
These stories work with ANY backend technology stack:
- Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, Go/Gin, Ruby/Rails, Java/Spring, etc.
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, etc.
- JWT, sessions, OAuth, etc.
- Docker, serverless, traditional hosting, etc.

The backend-developer agent will make all specific technology decisions based on research in Story #1.
