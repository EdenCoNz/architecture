## User Stories

### 1. Create Bug Resolver Workflow

Create a reusable workflow that manages issue labeling based on fix attempt outcomes. The workflow accepts information about the current fix attempt and the previous issue, then applies appropriate labels.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Workflow accepts inputs for current run status and previous issue number
- Workflow can be called from other workflows using workflow_call trigger
- Workflow applies correct labels based on success or failure scenarios

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: none

**Important**: This story describes WHAT needs to be achieved using generic, technology-agnostic language. ALL implementation details (technology choices, frameworks, libraries, tools, file formats, patterns, architecture) MUST be decided by the assigned development agent based on project context and best practices. DO NOT include ANY specific technology references in this story.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Bug logger workflow called automatically when frontend CI jobs fail
- All required failure context passed to bug logger (job results, branch name, PR info, run ID)
- Bug logger does not run when all jobs succeed

### 4. Add Commit Identifier Support to Bug Logger

Enhance the bug logger workflow to generate and include a commit identifier template in created issues. This identifier helps link fix commits back to the original issue.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Bug logger extracts issue number after creating the issue
- Generated commit identifier template includes issue reference
- Commit identifier template visible in issue body for developers to use

### 5. Create Issue Event Listener Workflow

Create a workflow that listens for issue creation events and filters for CI failure issues. This workflow serves as the foundation for automatically triggering fix attempts.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Workflow triggered when issues are created or labeled
- Workflow filters to only process issues with appropriate failure labels
- Workflow extracts issue metadata needed for fix command

### 6. Update Fix Command to Include Commit Identifier

Modify the fix command to extract the issue number from context and automatically include a commit identifier in the commit message that references the issue being fixed.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Fix command extracts issue number from execution context
- Generated commit message includes identifier linking to issue
- Commit message format follows established conventions

Agent: meta-developer
Dependencies: none

### 7. Integrate Fix Command Trigger from Issue Workflow

Extend the issue event listener workflow to automatically trigger the fix command when a new CI failure issue is created. The trigger should run asynchronously and pass the issue number.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Fix command automatically triggered when qualifying issue created
- Issue number passed correctly to fix command
- Fix attempt runs asynchronously without blocking issue creation

- Attempt count tracked across multiple failures
- Retry state information stored for downstream workflows
