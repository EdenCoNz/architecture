# Feature #7 Story #10: Add Retry Detection to Bug Logger - Implementation Summary

## Status: Complete

## Overview

Story #10 enhances the bug logger workflow to detect when a CI/CD failure is a retry attempt (second or subsequent failure for the same issue after a fix was attempted). The implementation tracks attempt counts across multiple failures and stores retry state information for downstream workflows.

## Implementation Details

### Core Enhancement

Enhanced the bug logger's duplicate detection step to include retry detection logic that:
1. Searches for closed issues with matching feature/job/step combinations
2. Identifies retries when closed issues had resolution labels (pending-merge, fix-pending)
3. Tracks total attempt count by counting all matching closed issues + current attempt
4. Exposes retry state via workflow outputs for downstream workflows (Story #11)

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Two-Stage Detection Process

**Location:** `.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml` lines 217-443

The detection logic runs in two sequential stages:

**Stage 1: Open Issue Detection (Duplicate Detection)**
- Searches for OPEN issues with matching title
- Compares feature ID, job name, step name, and log lines
- If exact match found: marks as duplicate, skips issue creation
- If partial match found: marks old issue for fix-pending label

**Stage 2: Closed Issue Detection (Retry Detection)**
- Only runs if no duplicate found in Stage 1
- Searches for CLOSED issues with matching title
- Compares feature ID, job name, and step name (NOT log lines)
- Identifies issues that were marked as resolved (pending-merge or fix-pending labels)
- Counts all matching closed issues to calculate attempt number

**Rationale:**
- Duplicates must be detected first to avoid creating multiple open issues
- Retries are only relevant when creating a new issue (not duplicates)
- Closed issues indicate previous fix attempts
- Log lines intentionally excluded from retry matching (error details can vary between attempts)

#### 2. Retry Detection Criteria

**Location:** `.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml` lines 372-382

A retry is detected when:
1. A closed issue exists with matching feature/job/step
2. The closed issue was labeled with "pending-merge" OR "fix-pending"
3. No open duplicate issue exists

**Rationale:**
- Resolution labels indicate a fix was attempted and merged
- Matching feature/job/step ensures it's the same underlying issue
- Closed state proves the fix was deployed but CI still failing

#### 3. Attempt Count Calculation

**Location:** `.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml` lines 391-398

```bash
ATTEMPT_COUNT = 1 (current attempt) + COUNT(matching closed issues)
```

**Example:**
- No closed issues: Attempt #1 (first occurrence)
- 1 closed issue: Attempt #2 (first retry)
- 2 closed issues: Attempt #3 (second retry)

**Rationale:**
- Provides clear indication of fix difficulty
- Helps prioritize issues requiring multiple attempts
- Useful for metrics and reporting

### New Workflow Outputs

**Location:** `.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml` lines 417-420

Three new outputs added to the `check-duplicate` step:

| Output | Type | Description | Example |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `is_retry` | boolean | Whether current failure is a retry attempt | `true` or `false` |
| `retry_of_issue` | string | Issue number of the previous closed issue (if retry) | `"42"` or `""` |
| `attempt_count` | number | Total number of attempts including current | `1`, `2`, `3`, etc. |

**Usage in Story #11:**
These outputs will be consumed by the bug resolver integration to:
- Call bug-resolver workflow when retry detected
- Pass previous issue number for labeling
- Include attempt count in comments/labels

### Enhanced Logging

**Location:** `.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml` lines 248-441

Added comprehensive structured logging:

```
========================================
Starting Duplicate and Retry Detection
========================================

STEP 1: Checking for Open Issues (Duplicates)
========================================
Found 1 open issues with similar titles
Checking issue #42...
  Result: DUPLICATE DETECTED

========================================
STEP 2: Checking for Closed Issues (Retry Detection)
========================================
Skipping retry detection (duplicate issue detected)

========================================
Detection Complete
========================================
Duplicate Detection:
  Is Duplicate: true
  Duplicate Issue: #42

Retry Detection:
  Is Retry: false
  Attempt Count: 1
========================================
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear visual separation between detection stages
- Easy to debug when reviewing workflow logs
- Structured format for log parsing/analysis
- Progress indicators for each operation

### Enhanced Summary Output

**Location:** `.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml` lines 619-640

Added retry detection section to GitHub Actions summary:

**For First Attempt:**
```markdown
### First Attempt

This is the **first occurrence** of this failure (Attempt #1)
```

**For Retry Attempt:**
```markdown
### Retry Detection

This is a **retry attempt** for a previously resolved issue.

- Previous Issue: [#42](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42) (closed)
- Attempt Count: **2**

A fix was previously attempted and merged, but the CI is still failing.
This may indicate the fix was incomplete or a regression occurred.
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear visibility in Actions UI
- Direct link to previous issue
- Explains retry significance
- Guides developers on next steps

## Files Modified

### 1. `.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml`

**Changes:**
- Renamed step: "Check for duplicate issues" → "Check for duplicate issues and retry detection"
- Added retry detection logic (Stage 2)
- Added three new workflow outputs: `is_retry`, `retry_of_issue`, `attempt_count`
- Enhanced logging with structured output
- Updated summary section to display retry information

**Lines Modified:**
- Lines 217-443: Main detection logic (previously lines 217-329)
- Lines 584-660: Summary output (added retry section)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing outputs preserved (`is_duplicate`, `duplicate_issue_number`, etc.)
- Existing steps unchanged (only one step modified)
- No breaking changes to workflow interface

## Technical Implementation

### Retry Detection Algorithm

```
1. IF duplicate found in Stage 1:
     SKIP retry detection
     SET is_retry = false
     SET attempt_count = 1
     EXIT

2. SEARCH for closed issues with matching title

3. FOR EACH closed issue:
     EXTRACT feature_id, job_name, step_name from issue body

     IF feature_id AND job_name AND step_name match current failure:
       ADD to matching_closed_issues list

       IF issue has "pending-merge" OR "fix-pending" label:
         IF is_retry still false:
           SET is_retry = true
           SET retry_of_issue = issue_number
           MARK as retry reference

4. CALCULATE attempt_count:
     attempt_count = 1 + COUNT(matching_closed_issues)

5. OUTPUT results for downstream workflows
```

### Why Log Lines Are Excluded from Retry Matching

**Duplicate Detection:** Compares log lines (must match exactly)
**Retry Detection:** Ignores log lines (only compares feature/job/step)

**Rationale:**
- Same underlying issue can produce slightly different error messages
- Log line numbers will definitely change between commits
- Feature/job/step combination is sufficient to identify same failure
- Too strict matching would miss legitimate retries

### Label-Based Retry Identification

The implementation only considers closed issues with resolution labels:
- `pending-merge`: Fix succeeded, waiting for merge
- `fix-pending`: Original issue may be resolved

**Why:**
- These labels indicate a fix was attempted and deployed
- Issues closed without labels (e.g., duplicates, invalid) should not trigger retry logic
- Ensures retry detection is accurate and meaningful

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing

**Test Case 1: First Failure (No Retry)**
1. Trigger CI failure on a new feature branch
2. Verify bug logger creates issue
3. Check summary shows "First Attempt" (Attempt #1)
4. Verify outputs: `is_retry=false`, `attempt_count=1`

**Test Case 2: Retry After Fix**
1. Create initial issue for a failure
2. Add "pending-merge" label to issue
3. Close the issue
4. Trigger same failure again (same feature/job/step)
5. Verify bug logger creates new issue
6. Check summary shows "Retry Detection" with reference to closed issue
7. Verify outputs: `is_retry=true`, `retry_of_issue=<previous>`, `attempt_count=2`

**Test Case 3: Multiple Retries**
1. Create and close two issues with "pending-merge" labels
2. Trigger same failure again
3. Verify attempt count is 3
4. Verify retry_of_issue references most recent closed issue

**Test Case 4: Duplicate Detection (Not Retry)**
1. Create open issue for a failure
2. Trigger exact same failure (same logs)
3. Verify bug logger detects duplicate
4. Verify no new issue created
5. Verify retry detection skipped

**Test Case 5: Different Failure (Not Retry)**
1. Create and close issue for Job A failure
2. Trigger failure in Job B on same feature
3. Verify new issue created
4. Verify NOT detected as retry
5. Verify old issue marked as fix-pending

### Expected Outcomes

| Scenario | Open Issue | Closed Issue | Labels | Result | is_retry | attempt_count |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|--------|----------|---------------|
| First failure | None | None | N/A | Create issue | false | 1 |
| Exact duplicate | Same issue | N/A | ci-failure | Skip (duplicate) | false | 1 |
| Retry after fix | None | Same feature/job/step | pending-merge | Create issue | true | 2 |
| Different failure | Different | N/A | N/A | Create issue, mark old fix-pending | false | 1 |
| Closed without labels | None | Same feature/job/step | None | Create issue | false | 1 |

### Validation Performed

1. **YAML Syntax Validation**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml')); print('✓ YAML syntax is valid')"
   ```
   **Result:** ✓ YAML syntax is valid

2. **Code Review**
   - Verified retry detection logic is sound
   - Confirmed outputs are set correctly
   - Validated backward compatibility
   - Checked error handling

3. **Integration Check**
   - Confirmed outputs available for Story #11
   - Verified no breaking changes to existing workflows
   - Validated workflow call interface unchanged

- Previous Issue: [#42](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42) (closed)
- Attempt Count: **2**

A fix was previously attempted and merged, but the CI is still failing.
This may indicate the fix was incomplete or a regression occurred.
```

## Performance Impact

### Additional GitHub API Calls

**Before Story #10:**
- 1 search for open issues

**After Story #10:**
- 1 search for open issues (unchanged)
- 1 search for closed issues (new, only when not duplicate)

**Impact:**
- Minimal (1 additional API call per non-duplicate failure)
- Closed issue search limited to 20 results
- Only runs when creating new issue (not for duplicates)

### Execution Time

**Estimated Additional Time:**
- 1-2 seconds for closed issue search and analysis
- Negligible compared to overall bug logger runtime (typically 20-30 seconds)

**Optimization:**
- Retry detection skipped when duplicate found (fast path)
- Limited search results (20 closed issues max)
- Efficient bash processing with jq

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Configurable Retry Limit**
   - Workflow input: `max_retry_attempts`
   - Stop creating issues after N retries
   - Escalate to human when limit reached

2. **Retry Metrics Dashboard**
   - Track retry rates by feature/job/step
   - Identify problematic areas
   - Generate reports

3. **Smart Label Management**
   - Add "retry-N" labels (retry-1, retry-2, etc.)
   - Different priority for retries
   - Auto-escalation based on attempt count

4. **Regression Detection**
   - Compare timestamps of closed issue vs current failure
   - Detect if regression occurred after long time
   - Different handling for recent vs old failures

## Observability and Debugging

### Structured Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging at each stage:

**Stage Indicators:**
```
========================================
STEP 1: Checking for Open Issues
========================================
```

**Progress Updates:**
```
Found 2 open issues with similar titles
Checking issue #42...
  Result: DUPLICATE DETECTED
```

**Decision Points:**
```
Retry Detection:
  Is Retry: true
  Retry of Issue: #42
  Attempt Count: 2
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to trace decision flow
- Quick identification of issues
- Clear visibility in Actions UI
- Structured format for parsing
