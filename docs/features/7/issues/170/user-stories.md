# Fix User Stories - Issue #170

**Issue Title**: Workflow Run #53 Failed: Backend CI/CD (0 failure(s))
**Feature ID**: 7 - Initialize Backend API
**Branch**: feature/7-initialise-backend-api
**Created**: 2025-10-24

## Overview

This document contains user stories to resolve CI/CD pipeline failures caused by missing Python dependencies in the production build environment. The build verification step fails because development-only debugging tools are being imported unconditionally, even though they are not installed in production builds.

## Business Context

When the backend application attempts to build for production deployment, the build process fails because the application code tries to load development debugging tools that aren't available in the production environment. This prevents the application from being deployed successfully, blocking the delivery of backend API functionality to users.

## Technical Reference

For implementation details, refer to the GitHub issue #170 which contains:
- Complete error traceback showing ModuleNotFoundError for 'debug_toolbar'
- CI/CD job logs identifying the "Collect static files" step failure
- Information about the django-debug-toolbar package location (requirements/dev.txt)

## User Story 1: Fix Development Tool Import in Production Build

**ID**: 7-170-1
**Title**: Resolve conditional import of development debugging tools
**Assigned To**: backend-developer
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

### Description

As a DevOps engineer managing application deployments, I need the backend application to build successfully in production environments so that I can deploy new versions of the API to users without encountering import errors for development-only tools.

The application currently attempts to import development debugging tools during the production build process, even though these tools are intentionally excluded from production dependencies. This causes the build to fail before the application can even start, preventing any deployment from succeeding.

### Business Value

- Unblocks backend API deployment pipeline
- Enables continuous delivery of backend features
- Prevents development tool dependencies from leaking into production
- Maintains clear separation between development and production environments

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I trigger a production build of the backend application in the CI/CD pipeline,
**When** the build process runs the "Collect static files" step,
**Then** the build should complete successfully without any module import errors.

**Given** the application is running in a production environment,
**When** development debugging tools are not installed,
**Then** the application should start and operate normally without attempting to load those tools.

**Given** the application is running in a development environment,
**When** development debugging tools are installed,
**Then** those tools should be available and functional as intended.

**Given** I review the application configuration code,
**When** I examine how optional development tools are loaded,
**Then** I should see defensive coding patterns that check for tool availability before attempting imports.

### Technical Notes for Implementation

The technical error details from issue #170 show:
- Error occurs in the "Collect static files" step during build verification
- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'debug_toolbar'
- The django-debug-toolbar package exists in requirements/dev.txt but not in production requirements
- The error traceback indicates the import happens during Django initialization
- Review config/urls.py and config/settings/development.py for debug_toolbar references

The implementation should:
- Use conditional imports with try/except blocks for development-only packages
- Only attempt to use development tools if they are successfully imported
- Ensure URL patterns and middleware only include development tools when available
- Maintain the existing development environment functionality

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Production build completes successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Static files collection step passes without import errors
- [ ] Development environment still has access to debugging tools when installed
- [ ] Production environment runs without attempting to import development tools
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline shows green status for Build Verification job

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Import Issues (Sequential)
1. **Story 7-170-1**: backend-developer - Resolve conditional import of development debugging tools

### Dependencies
- None (standalone fix)

### Success Metrics
- CI/CD Build Verification job passes successfully
- No ModuleNotFoundError exceptions during production builds
- Development environment functionality remains intact

## Summary

- **Total Stories**: 1
- **Assigned Agents**: backend-developer
- **Execution Phases**: 1
- **Estimated Timeline**: 1 day
- **Primary Goal**: Enable successful production builds by fixing unconditional imports of development-only dependencies
