# Fix for Issue #146: Workflow Failure - Backend CI/CD Dependency Conflict

## Overview
The backend CI/CD workflow is failing during dependency installation due to a version conflict between flake8 and flake8-django packages. The dev.txt requirements file specifies flake8>=7.0,<8.0, but flake8-django 1.4 requires flake8<7, creating an impossible dependency resolution. This prevents the type checking and other quality assurance workflows from running successfully.

## Issue Analysis
**Root Cause**: Incompatible version constraints where:
- User requirements specify: flake8>=7.0,<8.0
- flake8-django 1.4 depends on: flake8<7 and >=3.8.4

**Impact**: All CI/CD workflows that install dev dependencies are failing, blocking code quality checks, type verification, and automated testing from running on pull requests and commits.

## User Stories

### 1. Resolve Package Version Conflict
As a developer working on the backend, I want the development dependencies to install successfully so that I can run code quality tools and tests locally and in CI/CD pipelines.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I run the dependency installation command with the dev requirements file, when the installation process completes, then all packages should install without version conflicts
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs the dependency installation step, when it processes the requirements files, then it should complete successfully without errors
- Given the flake8 and flake8-django packages are both installed, when I check their versions, then they should be compatible with each other according to their dependency specifications
- Given the dependency resolution is complete, when I verify all code quality tools, then flake8, flake8-django, and their associated plugins should all be functional

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

## Notes

### Technical Context for Implementation
While the user story above is implementation-agnostic, the implementation agent should be aware of these possible resolution approaches:
1. Update flake8-django to a newer version that supports flake8>=7.0
2. Downgrade flake8 to a version compatible with flake8-django 1.4 (flake8<7)
3. Remove flake8-django if it's not providing significant value
4. Find an alternative Django-specific linting solution

The agent should investigate the current state of flake8-django package (check PyPI for newer versions), evaluate the value it provides to the project, and choose the most appropriate resolution strategy.

### Story Quality Validation
- Generic and implementation-agnostic: The story focuses on resolving the conflict without prescribing the specific solution
- User-focused: Describes the developer's need to install dependencies successfully
- Atomic: Single, focused issue that can be resolved in one session
- Testable: Acceptance criteria verify successful installation and functionality
