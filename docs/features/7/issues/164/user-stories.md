# Fix for Issue #164: Workflow Run #47 Failed: Backend CI/CD

## Overview
The backend CI/CD pipeline is failing with 2 job failures preventing deployment. The pipeline quality gates ensure code correctness through type checking and comprehensive test coverage. Currently, developers cannot merge changes because the type checker is reporting type annotation issues in the user management code, and the API documentation system tests are failing. These failures block the development workflow and prevent the backend API from being deployed.

## User Stories

### 1. Fix Type Annotation for User Creation
When developers run the type checking validation step in the CI/CD pipeline, the system should successfully verify that all user management code has correct type annotations without errors. The user creation functionality in the serializer needs proper type hints so that the type checker can validate the code correctly and ensure type safety across the authentication system.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs the type checking step, when it validates the user serializer code, then it should complete without type annotation errors
- Given developers are working on user authentication code, when they reference the user creation method, then the type checker should recognize the method as valid
- Given the type checking job runs, when it scans all user management files, then it should report zero type errors

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

**Technical Context for Implementation**:
The mypy type checker is reporting an error at line 103 in `apps/users/serializers.py`:
```
error: "Manager[AbstractBaseUser]" has no attribute "create_user"  [attr-defined]
```

The issue is that `User.objects` is typed as `Manager[AbstractBaseUser]` but the custom user manager with the `create_user` method is not being recognized by the type checker. There's already a `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` comment on line 102, but it's positioned incorrectly (the comment needs to be on the same line as the error, not the line before).

### 2. Fix API Documentation System
When developers run the test suite in the CI/CD pipeline, all API documentation tests should pass successfully. The API documentation system provides schema information about available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements. Currently, tests that validate the schema format and content are failing, which means the API documentation may not be working correctly for users who need to understand how to interact with the API.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs the test suite, when it executes API documentation tests, then all schema validation tests should pass
- Given developers query the API schema endpoint, when they request schema information, then they should receive valid, parseable documentation data
- Given the test suite runs, when it validates API documentation functionality, then there should be zero test failures or errors in the documentation test module

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

**Technical Context for Implementation**:
The tests in `tests/integration/test_api_documentation.py` are failing:
- `test_schema_is_valid_json` - FAILED (the schema endpoint is returning invalid JSON or the test cannot parse it)
- 19 ERROR tests in the API documentation test suite that cannot run due to test setup failures
- Additionally, `tests/integration/test_database_management.py::TestCheckDatabaseCommand::test_command_failure_without_database` is failing

The API schema endpoint tests are checking:
1. That the schema endpoint is accessible
2. That it returns valid JSON
3. That the schema has proper API information

The cascade of errors suggests the schema generation or endpoint configuration may have an issue that's preventing the tests from setting up correctly.

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Parallel)
- Story #1 (agent: backend-developer) - Fix type annotation for user creation
- Story #2 (agent: backend-developer) - Fix API documentation system

## Notes

### Story Quality Validation
- All stories are implementation-agnostic (focus on what needs to work, not specific implementation approaches)
- All stories describe user-observable outcomes (type checking passes, tests pass)
- All acceptance criteria are testable (CI/CD pipeline success/failure)
- Stories are atomic (each addresses one specific failure category)
- Stories can be worked on independently (no sequential dependencies)

### Technical Details for Developer
The technical context sections provide implementation guidance extracted from the CI/CD job logs:
- **Job 53539830142**: Type checking failure details
- **Job 53539830137**: Test failure details

These details help the backend-developer understand the specific errors encountered, but the user stories focus on the user-observable outcomes (passing CI/CD checks) rather than prescribing specific solutions.
