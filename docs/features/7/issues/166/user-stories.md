# Issue #166: Backend CI/CD Test Failures (11 failures)

## Overview
This issue addresses 11 test failures in the Backend CI/CD pipeline that are preventing successful builds. The failures fall into three categories: configuration and database testing issues (7 tests), example test patterns that serve as references for developers (4 tests), and management command output formatting (1 test). These failures block the deployment pipeline and could lead to developers copying broken test patterns.

## User Stories

### 1. Reliable Configuration and Database Testing
As a developer, I want the test suite to correctly validate configuration settings and database connectivity so that I can trust the tests catch real environment issues and database connection problems before they reach production.

The current test suite has issues with configuration error validation, database connection lifecycle management, test database naming in parallel test runs, and error message clarity. Tests need to properly validate that missing required configuration raises errors, database connections can be closed and reopened without errors, test database names work correctly with parallel test runners, hardcoded credentials are detected regardless of config function names, and error messages contain expected diagnostic information.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a required configuration value is missing, when the application attempts to retrieve it, then the system should raise a clear configuration error that tests can verify
- Given a database connection is established, when the connection is closed and reopened, then the connection should work without interface errors
- Given tests run in parallel with test runners that add worker suffixes, when checking test database names, then the validation should account for dynamic naming patterns
- Given the database connection health check fails, when error messages are generated, then they should include diagnostic information like "Connection refused" or the specific connection error
- Given configuration code uses any config retrieval function, when tests check for hardcoded credentials, then they should detect credentials regardless of function name syntax
- Given CSRF cookie settings are configured for production-like environments, when security tests validate cookie settings, then CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE should be properly enabled in production mode

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

**Technical Context for Implementation**:
The following tests are failing and need fixes:
- `tests/unit/test_config.py::TestConfigurationLoading::test_get_config_value_required_missing` - Should raise ConfigurationError for missing required config
- `tests/unit/test_database_connectivity.py::TestDatabaseConnectivity::test_database_connection_can_be_closed_and_reopened` - InterfaceError: connection already closed
- `tests/unit/test_database_connectivity.py::TestDatabaseHealthCheck::test_health_check_failure` - Error message missing "Connection refused" text
- `tests/unit/test_database_connectivity.py::TestEnvironmentConfiguration::test_no_hardcoded_credentials` - Looking for old config() syntax but code uses get_config()
- `tests/unit/test_test_database_config.py::TestTestDatabaseConfiguration::test_uses_correct_database_credentials_from_environment` - Test DB name has pytest-xdist worker suffix (_gw0)
- `tests/unit/test_cors_csrf_protection.py::TestCSRFProtection::test_csrf_cookie_secure_in_production` - CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE is False but expected True

Database logs show: "FATAL: role 'root' does not exist" errors during test runs.

### 2. Correct Example Test Patterns
As a developer, I want test example patterns to demonstrate correct testing approaches so that when I reference these examples to write new tests, I'm following working patterns that won't cause failures.

The test suite includes example patterns that demonstrate best practices for authentication flows, mocking health checks, and handling edge cases like duplicate data and invalid input. These examples are currently broken, which means developers copying these patterns will introduce bugs. The examples need to show correct authentication handling, proper health check response structure, accurate duplicate data validation, and proper input validation logic.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given an authentication endpoint is called with valid credentials, when the example test executes the flow, then it should receive successful authentication responses (not 401 errors)
- Given a health check endpoint is mocked, when the example test calls the health check, then the mocked response should include all expected fields like 'status'
- Given duplicate data is submitted that violates uniqueness constraints, when the example test validates this edge case, then it should demonstrate that the system properly raises integrity errors
- Given invalid input is submitted (such as malformed email addresses), when the example test validates input handling, then it should correctly demonstrate the validation logic rejecting invalid formats

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story 1

**Technical Context for Implementation**:
The following example tests are failing:
- `tests/test_example_patterns.py::TestAPIEndpointExamples::test_authentication_flow` - Returns 401 instead of 200
- `tests/test_example_patterns.py::TestMockingExamples::test_mocking_database_health_check` - KeyError: 'status' in mocked response
- `tests/test_example_patterns.py::TestEdgeCaseExamples::test_duplicate_email_raises_error` - DID NOT RAISE IntegrityError
- `tests/test_example_patterns.py::TestEdgeCaseExamples::test_invalid_email_format` - Test logic error: '@example.com' validation is wrong

Database logs show: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint 'users_email_key'" during test runs.

### 3. Clear Management Command Output
As a developer or operations engineer, I want management command output to clearly display the database type being used so that when I run database connectivity checks, I can immediately see which database system is configured.

The database connectivity check command currently works correctly and validates the connection, but the output format doesn't include the database system name (PostgreSQL) in the display, making it less clear what database type the system is connected to.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the database connectivity check command is executed successfully, when viewing the command output, then the output should display "PostgreSQL" to indicate the database system type
- Given the database connection is healthy, when the check runs, then all connection validation should still pass as it does now

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story 1

**Technical Context for Implementation**:
The following test is failing:
- `tests/integration/test_management_commands.py::TestCheckDatabaseCommand::test_check_database_success` - AssertionError: assert 'PostgreSQL' in output but not found

This is a cosmetic output formatting issue. The functionality works, only the output message needs updating.

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: backend-developer) - Fix configuration and database testing infrastructure first
- Story #2 (agent: backend-developer) - Fix example patterns that depend on working database/config
- Story #3 (agent: backend-developer) - Fix output formatting after core functionality is stable

---

## Notes

### Test Suite Status
- Total: 418 passed, 11 failed, 2 skipped, 317 warnings
- Test execution time: 10.62s
- Environment: PostgreSQL 16 (alpine), Redis 7 (alpine)

### Story Quality Guidelines
- Generic and implementation-agnostic (no frameworks, libraries, technologies)
- User-focused (describes WHAT users need, not HOW to build it)
- Atomic (1-3 days max, independently deployable)
- Testable (acceptance criteria are user-observable behaviors)
