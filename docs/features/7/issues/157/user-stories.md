# Fix Issue #157: Frontend CI/CD Pipeline Failures

## Overview
The frontend CI/CD pipeline is failing due to a JSX syntax error in the main application component. A single typo is causing cascading failures across linting, type checking, and testing steps. Users need the application code to be syntactically correct so that all CI/CD quality checks can pass and the application can be deployed successfully.

## Root Cause
In `frontend/src/App.tsx` at line 19, the opening JSX tag is misspelled as `<BrowserRoutewr>` instead of `<BrowserRouter>`, creating a tag mismatch with the correctly spelled closing tag `</BrowserRouter>` at line 54. This single typo causes:
- ESLint parsing failure (cannot parse JSX with mismatched tags)
- TypeScript compilation failure (same parsing issue)
- Test execution failure (tests cannot run due to syntax error)

## User Stories

### 1. Fix Application Routing Component Syntax Error
The application's main routing component has a typo in its JSX tag name, preventing the application from being built, tested, and deployed. Users need the routing component to be correctly defined so that the application can pass all quality checks and function properly.

The opening tag for the routing component is misspelled, causing a mismatch with its closing tag. This prevents the code from being parsed, compiled, or tested. All three CI/CD pipeline failures (linting, type checking, and testing) stem from this single syntax error.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I am a developer running the linting tool, when I execute ESLint on the codebase, then it should complete without parsing errors
- Given I am a developer running the type checker, when I execute TypeScript compilation, then it should complete successfully without JSX tag mismatch errors
- Given I am a developer running the test suite, when I execute the tests with coverage, then all tests should run and complete (pass or fail based on test logic, not syntax errors)
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs, when all quality checks execute, then the "Lint and Format Check", "TypeScript Type Check", and "Unit Tests with Coverage" steps should all pass

## Notes

### Implementation Context
This is a straightforward typo fix in a single location. The developer should:
- Locate the misspelled opening tag at line 19
- Verify that only the opening tag needs correction (closing tag is correct)
- Ensure no other similar typos exist in the file
- Confirm all CI/CD checks pass after the fix

### Quality Verification
After implementing the fix, the following must pass:
- ESLint parsing and linting
- TypeScript type checking and compilation
- Jest unit tests with coverage reporting
- All three corresponding GitHub Actions workflow steps
