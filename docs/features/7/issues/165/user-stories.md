# Fix for Issue #165: Backend CI/CD Test Failures

## Overview
Fix critical test failures in the Backend CI/CD pipeline that are preventing successful test execution. The failures affect database configuration, test data management, rate limiting security features, and management command functionality. These issues block the deployment pipeline and expose security vulnerabilities.

**Issue Number**: 165
**Feature ID**: 7
**Branch**: feature/7-initialise-backend-api
**Total Test Failures**: 29 tests (out of 426)

## User Stories

### 1. Fix Test Environment Database Configuration
As a developer running tests, I want the test environment to use the correct database backend and credentials, so that all database-dependent tests execute successfully and validate real-world database behavior.

The test environment is currently using SQLite instead of the configured PostgreSQL database, and connection attempts are using the wrong database user ('root' instead of 'test_user'). This causes database-specific features like JSONB support, PostgreSQL version queries, and schema introspection to fail, blocking validation of the production database behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When I run the test suite, the test environment should connect to PostgreSQL database successfully
- When I run database introspection tests, they should see 'django.db.backends.postgresql' as the configured backend, not SQLite
- When the test environment connects to the database, it should use the configured test user credentials without authentication failures
- When I review the PostgreSQL service logs, I should not see failed connection attempts with incorrect user credentials

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

**Technical Context**:
- Affects 12+ tests across test_database_connectivity.py, test_database_management.py, test_management_commands.py, test_example_patterns.py
- PostgreSQL service logs show 7+ failed connection attempts using 'root' user
- Error pattern: `AssertionError: assert 'django.db.backends.sqlite3' == 'django.db.backends.postgresql'`
- Connection error: `FATAL: role "root" does not exist`

### 2. Fix Test Data Seeding and Management Commands
As a developer or tester, I want the test data seeding command to create users successfully and management commands to support quiet mode, so that I can set up test environments reliably and run commands in automated scripts.

The seed_data management command is failing because it attempts to pass a 'username' argument to the User model which doesn't accept that parameter. Additionally, database check and config check commands don't recognize the '--quiet' flag, preventing their use in automation and scripts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When I run the seed_data command, it should create test users successfully without TypeError exceptions
- When I run database check and config check commands with the '--quiet' flag, they should execute without errors and suppress non-essential output
- When I review configuration validation error messages, they should contain clear, expected terminology (e.g., 'integer' for port validation, 'Configuration Validation' in check output)
- When the seed_data command completes, I should see confirmation that test data was created successfully

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story #1

**Technical Context**:
- Affects 8 tests in test_management_commands.py for seed_data command
- Affects 4 tests for --quiet flag support in database and config check commands
- Affects 2 tests for configuration validation error messages
- Error pattern: `TypeError: User() got unexpected keyword arguments: 'username'`
- Error pattern: `django.core.management.base.CommandError: Error: unrecognized arguments: --quiet`
- Error pattern: Configuration messages don't contain expected text ('integer', 'Configuration Validation')

### 3. Fix Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints
As a system administrator, I want rate limiting properly enforced on authentication endpoints, so that the API is protected from brute force attacks and credential stuffing attempts.

Rate limiting is currently not working on authentication endpoints. Tests that verify rate limiting protection are receiving HTTP 400 (Bad Request) responses instead of the expected HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when request limits are exceeded. This leaves the authentication system vulnerable to automated attacks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When I make excessive login requests beyond the configured threshold, I should receive HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
- When I make excessive registration requests beyond the configured threshold, I should receive HTTP 429 responses
- When rate limiting is triggered, I should receive a clear error message indicating I've been rate limited
- When the rate limit period expires, I should be able to make requests again successfully

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story #1

**Technical Context**:
- Affects 4 tests in test_rate_limiting.py (test_login_rate_limit_anonymous, test_login_rate_limit_authenticated, test_registration_rate_limit, test_password_reset_rate_limit)
- Error pattern: `assert 429 in [400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, ...]` - expected 429 but got 400
- Rate limiting middleware may not be configured or enabled on authentication endpoints
- Security vulnerability: API is currently unprotected from brute force attacks

### Key Error Patterns

**Database Backend Mismatch:**
```
AssertionError: assert 'django.db.backends.sqlite3' == 'django.db.backends.postgresql'
```

**PostgreSQL Connection Errors:**
```
2025-10-24 00:43:40.933 UTC [66] FATAL:  role "root" does not exist
```

**User Model TypeError:**
```
TypeError: User() got unexpected keyword arguments: 'username'
```

**Management Command Errors:**
```
django.core.management.base.CommandError: Error: unrecognized arguments: --quiet
```

**Rate Limiting Not Enforced:**
```
FAILED tests/unit/test_rate_limiting.py::TestRateLimiting::test_login_rate_limit_anonymous
assert 429 in [400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, ...]
```

**Configuration Error Message Mismatches:**
```
FAILED tests/unit/test_config.py::TestConfigurationValidation::test_validate_database_port_invalid
assert 'integer' in "...db_port must be a valid port number..."
```

## Notes

### Story Quality Validation
- All stories are atomic and independently testable
- Each story addresses a distinct root cause (database config, data seeding/commands, rate limiting)
- Stories focus on WHAT needs to work from a user/developer perspective
- Acceptance criteria are observable behaviors that can be verified by running tests
- Technical details are provided as reference but don't dictate HOW to implement

### Story Prioritization
- Story #1 is CRITICAL and blocks other tests - must be fixed first
- Stories #2 and #3 can be fixed in parallel after Story #1
- All stories must pass before the CI/CD pipeline can succeed

### Security Considerations
- Story #3 addresses a security vulnerability (missing rate limiting)
- Until fixed, authentication endpoints are vulnerable to brute force attacks
- This should be treated as a high-priority security fix
