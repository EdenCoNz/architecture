# Fix for Issue #147: Workflow Failure - Backend CI/CD Security Audit - Install Dependencies

## Overview
The backend CI/CD Security Audit workflow is failing during dependency installation with the same root cause as issue #146: a version conflict between flake8 and flake8-django packages. Issue #146 has already been fixed by removing flake8-django from the project dependencies (commit b58090f). This fix should resolve issue #147 as well, but requires verification through the CI/CD pipeline.

## Issue Analysis
**Root Cause**: Identical to issue #146 - incompatible version constraints:
- User requirements specify: flake8>=7.0,<8.0
- flake8-django 1.4 depends on: flake8<7 and >=3.8.4

**Fix Already Applied**: flake8-django has been removed from:
- backend/requirements/dev.txt
- backend/.pre-commit-config.yaml
- Related documentation updated

**Current Status**: Fix committed (b58090f) and pushed to feature/7-initialise-backend-api branch. Requires verification that Security Audit workflow now passes.

## User Stories

### 1. Verify Security Audit Workflow Success
As a developer working on the backend, I want to verify that the Security Audit workflow runs successfully after the flake8-django removal, so that I can confirm the dependency conflict is fully resolved across all CI/CD pipelines.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the fix for issue #146 has been applied, when the Security Audit workflow runs in CI/CD, then the dependency installation step should complete without version conflicts
- Given the workflow executes the security audit checks, when all steps complete, then the workflow should pass successfully
- Given the workflow completes successfully, when I review the workflow logs, then there should be no error messages related to flake8 or flake8-django dependency conflicts
- Given the fix is verified as working, when I close issue #147, then I should confirm that the same root cause (flake8-django conflict) has been resolved for both issues #146 and #147

**Agent**: devops-engineer
**Dependencies**: none (fix already committed)

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: devops-engineer)

---

## Notes

### Context
- **Same Root Cause**: Issue #147 has the identical root cause as issue #146 (flake8-django dependency conflict)
- **Fix Already Applied**: The fix from issue #146 (removing flake8-django) is already committed (b58090f) and pushed
- **Verification Focus**: This user story focuses on **verification** rather than implementation, since the fix is already in place
- **Multiple Workflows Affected**: The same dependency installation failure affected multiple workflows:
  - Type Checking workflow (issue #146)
  - Security Audit workflow (issue #147)

### Implementation Notes for devops-engineer
The agent should:
1. Verify the current branch (feature/7-initialise-backend-api) has the fix commit (b58090f)
2. Confirm the Security Audit workflow can be triggered
3. Monitor the workflow execution to ensure dependency installation succeeds
4. Review workflow logs to confirm no flake8-django related errors
5. If verification passes, update issue #147 to note it was resolved by the same fix as #146
6. If verification fails, investigate whether there are additional dependency conflicts or workflow-specific issues

### Story Quality Validation
- Generic and implementation-agnostic: Focuses on workflow verification outcomes, not specific tools or approaches
- User-focused: Describes developer's need to confirm CI/CD pipeline functionality
- Atomic: Single verification task that confirms the fix works across all affected workflows
- Testable: Acceptance criteria verify observable workflow outcomes (success/failure, log content)
