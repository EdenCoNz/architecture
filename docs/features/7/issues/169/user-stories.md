# Fix Issue #169: Missing Log Directory Configuration

## Overview
The backend application fails to start in CI/CD environments because the logging system expects a directory structure that doesn't exist. When the application tries to initialize, it cannot create log files in the expected location, causing the build to fail before any application code can run. This issue prevents deployment and blocks all CI/CD workflows.

## Issue Context
- **Issue Number**: 169
- **Feature ID**: 7 (Initialize Backend API)
- **Branch**: feature/7-initialise-backend-api
- **Failure Type**: Application Configuration Issue
- **Impact**: Complete build failure, preventing deployment

## Technical Reference
The Django logging configuration defines file handlers that write to `backend/logs/errors.log`, but the `logs/` directory doesn't exist in the CI/CD environment. The RotatingFileHandler fails when trying to create log files in a non-existent directory.

Error: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/runner/work/architecture/architecture/backend/logs/errors.log'`

## User Stories

### 1. Ensure Log Directory Exists Before Application Starts
The application needs to be able to write log files during initialization without manual directory creation. When the application starts in any environment (development, testing, CI/CD, production), it should automatically ensure that all required directories exist so that logging can function properly from the moment the application begins running.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the application is starting in a clean environment, when the logging system initializes, then the logs directory should exist automatically
- Given the logs directory already exists, when the application starts, then the existing directory should be preserved and reused
- Given the application runs the collectstatic command in CI/CD, when Django initializes the logging configuration, then the build should complete successfully without FileNotFoundError
- Given the application is deployed to any environment, when log files need to be written, then the files should be created successfully in the logs directory

## Notes

### Root Cause Analysis
This is an infrastructure configuration issue where the application expects a directory structure that must be created before the application can initialize. The logging configuration in Django settings references file paths that assume the parent directories exist.

### Implementation Approach (for agent reference)
The devops-engineer should ensure the logs directory is created as part of the application startup or build process. This could be achieved through:
- Application startup scripts that create required directories
- Django system checks or app initialization code
- CI/CD workflow configuration
- Container/deployment configuration files

The solution should work across all environments (local development, testing, CI/CD, production) and should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
