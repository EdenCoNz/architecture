## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Success Labeling (Primary Test Case)

**Description:** Verify that the bug resolver correctly applies pending-merge label when a fix attempt succeeds.

**Prerequisites:**
- An open issue in the repository
- Issue should not already have `pending-merge` label

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to GitHub Actions**
   ```
   Repository → Actions → Test Story #9 - Success Labeling Logic
   ```

2. **Trigger the Test Workflow**
   - Click "Run workflow" dropdown
   - Branch: Select current branch (feature/6-dark-mode-light-mode-toggle)
   - Issue number: Enter the number of an open issue (e.g., "9")
   - Click green "Run workflow" button

3. **Monitor Execution**
   - Wait for workflow to start (usually <5 seconds)
   - Click on the running workflow to view logs
   - Monitor the "Test Success Labeling" job

4. **Review Workflow Steps**
   - **Test Information**: Displays test configuration
   - **Call Bug Resolver Workflow**: Triggers bug-resolver with success status
   - **Verify Results**: Validates label and comment were added
   - **Summary**: Generates test results summary

5. **Verify Workflow Success**
   - All steps should have green checkmarks ✅
   - No red X marks indicating failures
   - "All Verification Checks Passed!" message in logs

6. **Verify Issue Changes**
   - Navigate to the test issue
   - Confirm `pending-merge` label is present
   - Confirm success comment was added
   - Comment should contain: "completed successfully"

**Expected Results:**
```
✅ Issue labeled with pending-merge
✅ Comment added with success message
✅ Comment text matches expected format
✅ Workflow completes without errors
✅ GitHub Actions summary shows success
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Workflow status: ✅ Success
- Issue has `pending-merge` label
- Issue has comment explaining successful fix
- No errors in workflow logs

### Scenario 2: Non-Existent Issue Handling

**Description:** Verify graceful handling when issue doesn't exist.

**Prerequisites:**
- Note of a non-existent issue number (e.g., 999999)

**Steps:**

1. **Run Test Workflow**
   - Navigate to: Actions → Test Story #9
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Enter non-existent issue number: 999999
   - Run workflow

2. **Monitor Execution**
   - Workflow should complete
   - "Check Issue Exists" step should detect missing issue

3. **Verify Graceful Failure**
   - Workflow should not crash
   - Warning logged about missing issue
   - No labels or comments attempted

**Expected Results:**
```
⚠️  WARNING: Issue #999999 not found or not open
Skipping label updates for non-existent or closed issue
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Workflow handles error gracefully
- No GitHub API errors
- Clear warning message logged
- Workflow doesn't attempt label/comment operations

### Scenario 3: Closed Issue Handling

**Description:** Verify workflow skips closed issues.

**Prerequisites:**
- A closed issue number

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Closed Issue**
   - Navigate to Issues → Closed
   - Note the issue number

2. **Run Test Workflow**
   - Trigger test workflow
   - Enter closed issue number

3. **Verify Behavior**
   - "Check Issue Exists" step detects closed state
   - Warning logged about closed issue
   - No label/comment updates attempted

**Expected Results:**
```
Issue state: CLOSED
Issue #42 is not open (state: CLOSED), skipping label update
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Closed issue detected correctly
- No modifications to closed issue
- Clear log message explaining skip

### Scenario 4: Direct Bug Resolver Call

**Description:** Test bug resolver workflow directly (not via test workflow).

**Prerequisites:**
- GitHub CLI installed locally
- Authenticated to GitHub
- Open issue for testing

**Steps:**

1. **Trigger Bug Resolver Directly**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run bug-resolver.yml \
     -f current_run_status=success \
     -f previous_issue_number=9 \
     -f action=mark_as_resolved
   ```

2. **Monitor Workflow**
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=bug-resolver.yml --limit 1
   ```

3. **View Logs**
   ```bash
   gh run view --log
   ```

4. **Verify Issue**
   ```bash
   gh issue view 9 --json labels,comments
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- Workflow completes successfully
- Issue has `pending-merge` label
- Issue has success comment

**Success Criteria:**
- Direct invocation works
- Parameters passed correctly
- Issue updated as expected

## Automated Verification

The test workflow includes automated verification steps:

### Label Verification

```bash
# Extract and check labels
ISSUE_DATA=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json labels)
HAS_PENDING_MERGE=$(echo "$ISSUE_DATA" | grep -o '"pending-merge"')

if [ -n "$HAS_PENDING_MERGE" ]; then
  echo "✓ SUCCESS: 'pending-merge' label found"
else
  echo "✗ FAILURE: 'pending-merge' label NOT found"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Comment Verification

```bash
# Check for success comment
COMMENT_TEXT=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER \
  --json comments \
  --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | contains("completed successfully")) | .body')

if [ -n "$COMMENT_TEXT" ]; then
  echo "✓ SUCCESS: Success comment found"
else
  echo "✗ FAILURE: Success comment NOT found"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Manual Verification Procedures

### Verify Label Application

1. **Navigate to Issue**
   ```
   Repository → Issues → #[issue_number]
   ```

2. **Check Labels Section**
   - Look for `pending-merge` label (usually in sidebar)
   - Label should be visible with appropriate color

3. **Verify Label Timing**
   - Check issue timeline
   - Label should have been added by github-actions bot
   - Timestamp should match workflow run time

### Verify Comment Creation

1. **Scroll to Comments**
   - Navigate to issue comments section
   - Look for latest comment from github-actions

2. **Verify Comment Content**
   Expected text:
   ```
   The fix attempt for this issue has completed successfully.
   The fix is now pending review and merge.
   Once merged, this issue can be closed.
   ```

3. **Check Comment Metadata**
   - Author: github-actions[bot]
   - Timestamp: Should match workflow run time
   - Format: Plain text, no code blocks

### Verify GitHub Actions Summary

1. **Navigate to Workflow Run**
   ```
   Repository → Actions → [Workflow Run]
   ```

2. **Check Summary Section**
   - Click on workflow run
   - Scroll to Summary section

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow Fails at "Call Bug Resolver Workflow" Step

**Symptoms:**
- Test workflow fails at workflow_call step
- Error: "workflow is not reachable"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Bug resolver workflow file has syntax errors
2. Workflow file is not in .github/workflows/
3. Branch doesn't have latest workflow files

**Solutions:**

1. **Validate YAML Syntax**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/bug-resolver.yml')); print('✓ Valid')"
   ```

2. **Verify File Location**
   ```bash
   ls -la .github/workflows/bug-resolver.yml
   ```

3. **Check Branch**
   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline -1
   ```

4. **Pull Latest Changes**
   ```bash
   git pull origin feature/6-dark-mode-light-mode-toggle
   ```

### Issue: Label Not Applied

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow succeeds
- No `pending-merge` label on issue

**Possible Causes:**
1. Issue is closed
2. Wrong issue number provided
3. GitHub permissions insufficient
4. Condition not met in workflow

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Issue State**
   ```bash
   gh issue view [number] --json state
   ```

2. **Check Workflow Logs**
   - Look for "Check if issue exists" step
   - Verify `issue_exists=true` in output

3. **Review Conditions**
   ```yaml
   if: |
     steps.check-issue.outputs.issue_exists == 'true' &&
     inputs.action == 'mark_as_resolved' &&
     inputs.current_run_status == 'success'
   ```

4. **Verify Permissions**
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     issues: write  # Required
   ```

### Issue: Comment Not Created

**Symptoms:**
- Label applied successfully
- No comment on issue

**Possible Causes:**
1. GitHub CLI command failed
2. Network timeout
3. Rate limiting

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Workflow Logs**
   - Look for "Mark issue as resolved" step
   - Check for gh command output

2. **Verify GitHub CLI**
   ```bash
   gh --version
   gh auth status
   ```

3. **Manual Comment Test**
   ```bash
   gh issue comment [number] --body "Test comment"
   ```

4. **Check Rate Limits**
   ```bash
   gh api rate_limit
   ```

### Issue: Verification Step Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Bug resolver succeeds
- Verification step reports failure

**Possible Causes:**
1. Timing issue (eventual consistency)
2. Incorrect search pattern
3. Label/comment not yet visible

**Solutions:**

1. **Add Delay Before Verification**
   ```yaml
   - name: Wait for propagation
     run: sleep 5
   ```

2. **Manual Verification**
   ```bash
   gh issue view [number] --json labels,comments
   ```

3. **Check Search Pattern**
   - Verify grep pattern matches expected text
   - Check for typos in expected strings

## Test Data Cleanup

After testing, you may want to clean up test artifacts:

### Remove Test Labels

```bash
# Remove pending-merge label from test issue
gh issue edit [issue_number] --remove-label "pending-merge"
```

### Delete Test Comments (Optional)

1. Navigate to issue in browser
2. Find test comment from github-actions
3. Click "..." menu → Delete

### Alternative: Keep Test Data

Consider keeping test artifacts for:
- Future reference
- Demonstration purposes
- Audit trail
- Documentation screenshots

## Continuous Testing

### Pre-Merge Checklist

Before merging Story #9 implementation:

- [ ] Run test-story-9-success-labeling.yml successfully
- [ ] Verify YAML syntax for all workflow files
- [ ] Check workflow file permissions are minimal
- [ ] Validate issue updates occur correctly
- [ ] Review GitHub Actions summary output
- [ ] Test with multiple issue states (open, closed)
- [ ] Test with non-existent issue number
- [ ] Document any issues found
- [ ] Verify integration with bug-resolver.yml

### Regression Testing

When modifying related workflows:

1. **After Changes to bug-resolver.yml**
   - Re-run test-story-9-success-labeling.yml
   - Verify all tests still pass
   - Check for new edge cases

2. **After Changes to bug-logger.yml**
   - Verify integration still works
   - Test end-to-end flow
   - Check label application timing

3. **After GitHub Actions Platform Updates**
   - Test workflow compatibility
   - Verify GitHub CLI still works
   - Check for deprecated features

## Performance Considerations

### Workflow Timing

Typical workflow execution times:

| Step | Expected Duration |
|------|-------------------|
| Test Information | <5 seconds |
| Call Bug Resolver | 10-20 seconds |
| Verify Results | 5-10 seconds |
| Summary | <5 seconds |
| **Total** | **<45 seconds** |

If workflow takes longer:
- Check GitHub Actions queue time
- Verify network connectivity
- Review GitHub status page

### Rate Limiting

GitHub API has rate limits:
- **Authenticated API**: 5,000 requests/hour
- **GitHub CLI (gh)**: Same as API limits

Avoid:
- Running test workflow in tight loops
- Multiple simultaneous test executions
- Unnecessary API calls

## Security Testing

### Permission Validation

Verify minimal permissions are used:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read   # Read-only repository access
  issues: write    # Required for labels/comments
```

Test scenarios:
1. Remove `issues: write` → Should fail gracefully
2. Add unnecessary permissions → Should not be needed
3. Use custom token → Should work with same permissions

### Input Validation Testing

Test with malicious inputs:

1. **SQL Injection Attempt**
   ```
   Issue number: 1; DROP TABLE issues--
   ```
   Expected: Validation rejects non-numeric input

2. **Command Injection Attempt**
   ```
   Issue number: 1 && rm -rf /
   ```
   Expected: Validation rejects non-numeric input

3. **XSS Attempt**
   ```
   Issue number: 1<script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
   Expected: Validation rejects non-numeric input

All malicious inputs should be rejected at validation step.

## Documentation Verification
