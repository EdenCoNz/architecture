## Fix #170 - Workflow Run #53 Failed: Backend CI/CD (2025-10-24T03:40:00Z)

**Issue**: Backend CI/CD build failure - unconditional import of development-only debug_toolbar package in production

**Stories**: 1 completed

**Key Changes**:
- Modified `backend/config/urls.py` to use try/except for debug_toolbar import, preventing ModuleNotFoundError in production builds
- Updated `backend/config/settings/development.py` to conditionally add dev packages (debug_toolbar, django_extensions) only when successfully imported

**Files Modified**:
- backend/config/urls.py
- backend/config/settings/development.py

**Files Created**:
- backend/tests/unit/test_conditional_imports.py (8 comprehensive tests following TDD approach)

**Technical Approach**:
- Applied defensive coding pattern using try/except blocks for optional development dependencies
- Followed TDD methodology (Red-Green-Refactor) to ensure fix works correctly
- Ensured development environment functionality is preserved while enabling production builds to succeed

**Test Results**:
- 8 tests created
- 7 tests passed
- 1 test skipped (dev-specific)
- 0 tests failed

**Impact**: Production builds now complete successfully without attempting to import development-only packages. Development environment retains full debugging capabilities when packages are installed.
