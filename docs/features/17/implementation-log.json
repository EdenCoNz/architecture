      "Story 17.10 completes Feature 17 by integrating logging guidelines into agent workflows (Phase 6: Integration in execution plan)",
      "Integrated logging guidelines into 5 specialized agents that perform implementation work: frontend-developer, backend-developer, devops-engineer, ui-ux-designer, meta-developer",
      "Product-owner and research-specialist agents were excluded from integration because they do not create implementation logs (product-owner creates user stories, research-specialist provides research findings)",
      "Integration positioned as workflow step 2 (immediately after configuration documentation, before implementation) for all 5 agents, maintaining consistency with existing workflow patterns",
      "Integration text is identical across all 5 agents: 3 bullets totaling 3 sentences with (1) document reference, (2) Quick Reference Checklist decision rule, (3) outcome vs process reminder",
      "Quick Reference Checklist decision rule (CHANGE \u2192 Essential | DISCOVER \u2192 Contextual | ROUTINE \u2192 Optional/Skip) provides immediate decision-making capability without reading 3000+ line guidelines document",
      "All subsequent workflow steps were renumbered after inserting new step 2: frontend-developer (3-8), backend-developer (3-7), devops-engineer (3-9), ui-ux-designer (3-7), meta-developer (3-9)",
      "Integration maintains single source of truth: all agents reference docs/guides/logging-guidelines.md by path rather than duplicating content",
      "All 4 acceptance criteria met: (1) reference visible in all agent workflows before implementation, (2) Quick Reference decision rule reminds agents to classify actions, (3) exactly 3 sentences avoiding clutter, (4) central document referenced not duplicated",
      "Integration is lightweight yet effective: 3 bullets provide document location, fast decision framework, and core principle (outcomes not process) without overwhelming agent definitions",
      "Story 17.10 completes Feature 17: all 10 user stories now complete (17.1-17.10)",
      "Feature 17 execution complete: Phase 1 (Foundation - Story 17.1) \u2192 Phase 2 (Level-Specific Criteria - Stories 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.6) \u2192 Phase 3 (Decision Support - Story 17.5) \u2192 Phase 4 (Practical Application - Stories 17.7, 17.9) \u2192 Phase 5 (Quick Reference - Story 17.8) \u2192 Phase 6 (Integration - Story 17.10)",
      "Combined impact of Feature 17: (1) 3000+ line comprehensive logging guidelines document, (2) Quick Reference Checklist for 3-second decisions, (3) Agent-specific examples for 5 agent types, (4) Good vs Bad comparisons with 7 examples, (5) Integration into all implementation-focused agents",
      "Feature 17 achieves core business value: reducing token consumption through clear logging criteria, faster agent decision-making through Quick Reference, higher quality logs focused on outcomes, consistent logging across all agents, foundation for future workflow improvements",
      "Total files modified: 5 agent definitions (.claude/agents/*.md), all modifications add new workflow step 2 with identical integration text",
      "Zero files created: integration leverages existing agent definitions and existing logging guidelines document from Stories 17.1-17.9",
      "Integration design enables future expansion: if new specialized agents are added, same 3-bullet integration text can be copied to their workflow section",
      "Feature 17 now provides complete logging guidance system: comprehensive guidelines (Stories 17.1-17.9) + workflow integration (Story 17.10) ensuring all agents are reminded to follow logging standards",
      "Story 17.10 implementation time: approximately 30 minutes including reading configuration docs, analyzing agent structures, designing integration text, editing 5 agents, renumbering workflows, validation, and implementation log creation"
