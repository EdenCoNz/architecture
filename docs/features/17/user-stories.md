# Feature #17: Logging Guidelines & Standards

## Feature Overview

**Feature ID**: 17
**Title**: Logging Guidelines & Standards
**Created**: 2025-10-31

### Description

Create comprehensive logging guidelines that define what to log, what to omit, and how to structure implementation logs for optimal value-to-noise ratio. These guidelines will help all agents understand when and how to document their work, ensuring implementation logs provide maximum value without overwhelming detail or unnecessary noise.

### Business Value

- Reduced token consumption across all implementation workflows
- Faster agent decision-making through clear logging criteria
- Higher quality implementation logs focused on outcomes rather than process
- Better debugging and troubleshooting through meaningful log entries
- Consistent logging approach across all specialized agents
- Improved maintainability of implementation documentation
- Foundation for future workflow and documentation improvements

## User Stories

### Story 17.1: Define Three-Tier Logging Level Framework

**Title**: Define Three-Tier Logging Level Framework
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.1

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want a clear framework that categorizes actions into Essential, Contextual, and Optional logging levels so that I can quickly determine the appropriate level of detail to document for each action I perform.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I read the logging guidelines document, when I view the logging level definitions, then I should see three distinct tiers: Essential, Contextual, and Optional
- Given each logging level is defined, when I review the criteria for each level, then I should understand what types of actions belong in each category
- Given I encounter a typical action during implementation, when I reference the level definitions, then I should be able to classify it within 5 seconds
- Given the three tiers are documented, when I compare actions across different tiers, then the distinction between levels should be clear and unambiguous

**Dependencies**: None

### Story 17.2: Provide Essential Logging Examples and Criteria

**Title**: Provide Essential Logging Examples and Criteria
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.2

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want detailed criteria and examples for Essential-level logging so that I understand which critical actions must always be documented in implementation logs regardless of context.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I read the Essential logging section, when I view the criteria, then I should see clear rules for what qualifies as Essential (e.g., file creations, deletions, configuration changes, deployment actions)
- Given the Essential criteria are defined, when I review concrete examples, then I should see at least 5-7 examples with explanations of why each is Essential
- Given I create a new file during implementation, when I check the Essential criteria, then I should immediately recognize this action requires logging
- Given I perform a routine read operation, when I check the Essential criteria, then I should recognize this action does NOT require Essential logging

### Story 17.3: Provide Contextual Logging Examples and Criteria

**Title**: Provide Contextual Logging Examples and Criteria
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.3

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want detailed criteria and examples for Contextual-level logging so that I understand which actions should be logged when they provide meaningful context but are not absolutely critical to document.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I read the Contextual logging section, when I view the criteria, then I should see clear rules for what qualifies as Contextual (e.g., important read operations, validation checks, significant search operations)
- Given the Contextual criteria are defined, when I review concrete examples, then I should see at least 5-7 examples with explanations of why each is Contextual rather than Essential or Optional
- Given I perform a complex search to understand code structure, when I check the Contextual criteria, then I should recognize when this action adds value to the log versus when it's just noise
- Given I perform multiple sequential validation checks, when I reference the Contextual criteria, then I should understand whether to log each check or summarize them

### Story 17.4: Provide Optional Logging Examples and Criteria

**Title**: Provide Optional Logging Examples and Criteria
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.4

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want detailed criteria and examples for Optional-level logging so that I understand which actions typically should NOT be logged unless there's a specific reason they provide unique value in a particular context.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I read the Optional logging section, when I view the criteria, then I should see clear rules for what qualifies as Optional (e.g., routine file reads, exploratory searches, standard validation checks)
- Given the Optional criteria are defined, when I review concrete examples, then I should see at least 5-7 examples with explanations of why these actions are typically noise rather than signal
- Given I perform my tenth file read in a row, when I check the Optional criteria, then I should recognize these routine reads should not clutter the implementation log
- Given I encounter a situation where an Optional action actually provides critical context, when I review the guidelines, then I should see guidance on when to elevate Optional actions to Contextual or Essential

### Story 17.5: Create Logging Decision Matrix

**Title**: Create Logging Decision Matrix
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.5

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want a simple decision matrix or flowchart that helps me answer "Should I log this action?" so that I can make fast, consistent logging decisions throughout my implementation work without repeatedly re-reading detailed criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I need to decide whether to log an action, when I reference the decision matrix, then I should be able to answer "yes/no/maybe" within 3-5 seconds
- Given the matrix is structured as a flowchart or decision tree, when I follow the branches based on my action characteristics, then I should arrive at a clear recommendation (Essential, Contextual, Optional, or Skip)
- Given I use the decision matrix 5 times, when I encounter a similar action the 6th time, then the pattern should be memorable enough that I no longer need to reference the matrix
- Given the matrix covers common scenarios, when I encounter an edge case not explicitly covered, then the matrix should provide guidance on how to reason about novel situations

### Story 17.6: Document Outcome-Focused vs Process-Focused Logging

**Title**: Document Outcome-Focused vs Process-Focused Logging
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.6

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want clear guidance on outcome-focused versus process-focused logging so that I understand when to document what I accomplished versus documenting every step I took to accomplish it.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I read the outcome vs process section, when I view the definitions, then I should clearly understand the difference between documenting outcomes (what was achieved) and processes (how it was achieved)
- Given the definitions are clear, when I review comparative examples, then I should see at least 3-5 side-by-side comparisons showing process-focused logging vs outcome-focused logging for the same action
- Given I complete a complex task involving 10 substeps, when I apply outcome-focused logging, then I should recognize I can document the final result rather than all 10 substeps
- Given I encounter a situation where process details matter (e.g., debugging a complex issue), when I reference this guidance, then I should see criteria for when process-focused logging is appropriate

### Story 17.8: Create Quick Reference Logging Checklist

**Title**: Create Quick Reference Logging Checklist
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.8

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want a concise quick-reference checklist that summarizes key logging principles so that I can quickly review logging best practices before starting implementation work or when I'm uncertain about a logging decision.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I need a quick logging reminder, when I access the quick reference checklist, then I should be able to read and absorb the entire checklist in under 30 seconds
- Given the checklist covers essential principles, when I review the items, then I should see no more than 10-12 key points covering the most critical logging decisions
- Given the checklist is designed for quick reference, when I compare it to the full guidelines, then it should contain no detailed explanations, only concise reminders
- Given I use the checklist before starting implementation, when I encounter logging decisions during my work, then I should recall the relevant checklist items without needing to re-read the full guidelines

### Story 17.9: Document Good vs Bad Logging Examples

**Title**: Document Good vs Bad Logging Examples
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.9

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want side-by-side examples comparing good logging practices with bad logging practices so that I can clearly see what effective implementation logs look like and recognize patterns to avoid.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I review the good vs bad examples section, when I read through the examples, then I should see at least 5-7 side-by-side comparisons
- Given each comparison is presented, when I review a "bad" example, then I should see clear annotations explaining why it's problematic (too verbose, lacking context, wrong level, etc.)
- Given each comparison is presented, when I review a "good" example, then I should see clear annotations explaining why it's effective (appropriate detail level, clear outcomes, valuable context)
- Given I study these examples, when I write my own implementation logs, then I should be able to self-correct by recognizing when my logging resembles the "bad" patterns

### Story 17.10: Integrate Logging Guidelines into Agent Workflows

**Title**: Integrate Logging Guidelines into Agent Workflows
**Agent**: meta-developer
**Story ID**: Story-17.10

**Description**:
As a specialized agent, I want the logging guidelines to be referenced in my agent definition or workflow instructions so that I'm automatically reminded to follow the logging standards when I begin implementation work.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I am invoked as a specialized agent, when I review my workflow instructions, then I should see a reference to the logging guidelines document with guidance to review it before beginning implementation
- Given the logging guidelines are referenced, when I start implementation work, then I should be reminded to consider whether my actions warrant logging according to the established criteria
- Given the integration is lightweight, when I read the agent workflow, then the logging reminder should not add more than 2-3 sentences to avoid cluttering agent definitions
- Given multiple agents reference the guidelines, when the guidelines are updated, then agents should reference the central document rather than duplicating guidelines in each agent definition

**Dependencies**: Story-17.1, Story-17.2, Story-17.3, Story-17.4, Story-17.5, Story-17.6, Story-17.7, Story-17.8, Story-17.9
