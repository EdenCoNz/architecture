## Feature Overview

**Feature ID**: 12
**Title**: Unified Multi-Service Orchestration
**Description**: Enable developers and operators to deploy and run the complete application stack (frontend, backend, database, web server, and reverse proxy) as a unified system in any environment (local development, staging, production) using a single orchestration configuration that manages service dependencies, networking, and environment-specific settings.

**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Planning

## User Stories

### Story 12.1: Unified Service Orchestration Configuration

**Title**: Unified Service Orchestration Configuration
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 3
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a developer, I want to start all application services (frontend, backend, database, web server, reverse proxy) with a single command, so that I can run the complete application stack locally without managing each service individually or understanding complex networking requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I run the orchestration start command, when all services initialize, then I should be able to access the complete application through a single entry point
- Given all services are running, when I access the application, then the frontend should successfully communicate with the backend through the reverse proxy
- Given I stop the orchestration, when I run the stop command, then all services should stop cleanly and release resources
- Given I restart the orchestration, when services start again, then all data and state should be preserved from the previous session

**Dependencies**: None

**Notes**:
- Builds upon individual container work from Feature 8
- Should define all services: frontend, backend, database, web server/reverse proxy
- Should configure inter-service networking automatically
- Should work in any environment with container runtime

### Story 12.2: Service Dependency Management

**Title**: Service Dependency Management
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a developer, I want services to start in the correct order based on their dependencies, so that dependent services don't fail because required services aren't ready yet.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I start the orchestration, when services initialize, then the database should be ready before the backend attempts to connect
- Given the backend is starting, when it needs the database, then the database should already be accepting connections
- Given the reverse proxy is starting, when it configures routing, then both frontend and backend services should already be running
- Given a service fails to start, when I check the logs, then I should see clear indication of which dependency was not available

**Dependencies**: 12.1

**Notes**:
- Database should start first
- Backend should wait for database readiness
- Frontend can start independently
- Reverse proxy should start last, after frontend and backend are ready
- Should use health checks to verify service readiness

---

### Story 12.3: Reverse Proxy Configuration

**Title**: Reverse Proxy Configuration
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 3
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a user, I want to access both the frontend and backend through a single domain/port, so that I don't need to remember multiple URLs or deal with cross-origin issues between frontend and backend.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I access the application root URL, when the request reaches the reverse proxy, then I should see the frontend application
- Given the frontend makes API requests, when requests go to the API path, then they should be routed to the backend service
- Given I access the application, when I use the service, then I should not encounter cross-origin errors between frontend and backend
- Given services are behind the reverse proxy, when I access them, then response headers should include appropriate security and caching directives

**Dependencies**: 12.1

**Notes**:
- Should route requests to appropriate services based on path
- Should handle static files efficiently
- Should support WebSocket connections if needed
- Should add security headers
- Should enable compression for responses

### Story 12.4: Environment-Specific Configuration

**Title**: Environment-Specific Configuration
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to use the same orchestration configuration for local development, staging, and production environments, so that I can ensure consistency across environments while allowing environment-specific customizations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I deploy to different environments, when services start, then each environment should load its appropriate configuration (ports, URLs, resource limits)
- Given I switch environments, when I change the environment setting, then services should use the correct configuration without modifying the orchestration file
- Given I review environment configurations, when I check for differences, then I should clearly see what varies between local, staging, and production
- Given a new environment is needed, when I create its configuration, then it should follow the same structure as existing environments

**Dependencies**: 12.1

**Notes**:
- Should support local, staging, and production environments
- Environment variables should control environment-specific behavior
- Should provide example configurations for each environment
- Should validate required configuration is present before starting

### Story 12.5: Service Isolation and Networking

**Title**: Service Isolation and Networking
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a security-conscious operator, I want services to communicate through a private network with only necessary ports exposed, so that the application is secure and services are isolated from external access except through the reverse proxy.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given services are running, when I inspect the network, then only the reverse proxy port should be accessible from outside
- Given services need to communicate, when they connect, then they should use the private internal network
- Given I access the database, when I attempt a direct connection from outside, then it should be blocked (only accessible to backend service)
- Given I start multiple application instances, when they run simultaneously, then they should be isolated from each other

**Dependencies**: 12.1, 12.3

**Notes**:
- Should create isolated network for all services
- Only reverse proxy should expose ports to host
- Database should only be accessible to backend
- Backend should only be accessible through reverse proxy
- Should prevent port conflicts for multiple instances

### Story 12.6: Persistent Data Management

**Title**: Persistent Data Management
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a developer, I want application data to persist between service restarts, so that I don't lose my work when I stop and restart the application stack.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I create data in the application, when I stop and restart services, then my data should still be present
- Given I update database schema, when I restart services, then schema changes should be preserved
- Given I upload files or create content, when services restart, then that content should remain available
- Given I need to reset my environment, when I run the cleanup command, then I should be able to remove all persistent data

**Dependencies**: 12.1

**Notes**:
- Should use volumes for database data persistence
- Should persist uploaded files and media
- Should handle log files appropriately

### Story 12.8: Production Environment Optimizations

**Title**: Production Environment Optimizations
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 3
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a DevOps engineer, I want production deployments to use optimized containers with proper resource limits and security settings, so that the application runs efficiently and securely in production environments.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I deploy to production, when services start, then they should use production-optimized containers
- Given services are running in production, when I monitor resources, then services should respect defined CPU and memory limits
- Given the application is in production, when I check security settings, then services should run as non-root users with minimal privileges
- Given production is deployed, when I review the configuration, then development tools and debug features should be disabled

**Dependencies**: 12.1, 12.3, 12.4

**Notes**:
- Should use multi-stage production containers from Feature 8

### Story 12.9: Service Health Monitoring

**Title**: Service Health Monitoring
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: Medium

**Description**:
As an operator, I want to monitor the health of all services and have unhealthy services automatically restarted, so that the application remains available even when individual services experience issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given services are running, when I check their status, then I should see the health of each service (healthy/unhealthy)
- Given a service becomes unresponsive, when the health check fails, then the service should be automatically restarted
- Given a service repeatedly fails, when restart attempts are exhausted, then I should be notified of the persistent failure
- Given I want to understand service issues, when I check the health status, then I should see the last health check result and timestamp

**Dependencies**: 12.1, 12.2

**Notes**:

## Story Refinement Summary

### Initial Stories Created: 11
Stories after atomicity refinement: 11

### Stories Split: 0
No stories required splitting - all stories were atomic from initial creation.

### Average Acceptance Criteria: 4.0
All stories have 4 acceptance criteria, providing clear, testable outcomes without being overly prescriptive.

### Atomicity Decisions Made:
1. **Service Orchestration Configuration** - Kept as single story because it defines the foundational capability
2. **Environment-Specific Configuration** - Separated from orchestration config because it's a distinct capability
3. **Development vs Production Optimizations** - Split into separate stories because they serve different user needs and can be implemented independently
4. **Monitoring** - Kept separate from validation because monitoring is continuous while validation is on-demand
5. **Documentation** - Single story covering all orchestration documentation as it's one deliverable
