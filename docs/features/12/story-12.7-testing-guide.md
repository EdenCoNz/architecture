## Test Execution

### Test 1: Frontend Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

**Acceptance Criteria**: Given I modify frontend code, when I save the file, then the browser should automatically reload with my changes

**Test Steps:**

1. Start development environment:
   ```bash
   ./docker-dev.sh start
   ```

2. Wait for all services to be healthy:
   ```bash
   ./docker-dev.sh status
   ```
   Expected: All services show "healthy" status

3. Open frontend in browser:
   - URL: http://localhost:5173
   - Expected: Application loads successfully

4. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab
   - Expected: Look for "[vite] connected" message indicating HMR is active

5. Edit a frontend file:
   ```bash
   # Open frontend/src/App.tsx in your editor
   # Make a visible change (e.g., change text in a heading)
   # Save the file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)
   ```

6. Observe browser:
   - Expected: Browser updates within ~100ms without full page reload
   - Expected: Console shows "[vite] hot updated: /src/App.tsx"
   - Expected: Application state is preserved (if applicable)

7. Test with multiple file types:
   - Edit `.tsx` file - Expected: Hot reload
   - Edit `.css` file - Expected: Hot reload without page refresh
   - Edit `.ts` file - Expected: Hot reload

8. Check logs:
   ```bash
   ./docker-dev.sh logs frontend
   ```
   Expected: See "hmr update /src/..." messages

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Changes appear in browser within 100ms
- ✅ No full page reload occurs (check DevTools Network tab)
- ✅ HMR WebSocket connection remains active
- ✅ Works for all file types (.tsx, .css, .ts)

---

### Test 2: Backend Auto-reload

**Acceptance Criteria**: Given I modify backend code, when I save the file, then the backend should restart automatically with my changes

**Test Steps:**

1. Ensure backend is running:
   ```bash
   ./docker-dev.sh status
   ```
   Expected: Backend shows "healthy"

2. Open logs in separate terminal:
   ```bash
   ./docker-dev.sh logs backend
   ```

3. Edit a backend file:
   ```bash
   # Open backend/config/settings/development.py
   # Add a comment or modify a non-critical setting
   # Save the file
   ```

4. Observe logs:
   - Expected: See "Watching for file changes with watchdog"
   - Expected: See "Detected file change"
   - Expected: See "Reloading..."
   - Expected: See Django startup messages
   - Timeline: Should complete within 1-2 seconds

5. Test with different file types:
   - Edit `.py` file - Expected: Auto-reload
   - Edit Django template - Expected: Auto-reload
   - Edit static file - Expected: No reload (static files served directly)

6. Test API endpoint still works:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/
   ```
   Expected: Returns {"status": "healthy"}

7. Test with syntax error:
   ```bash
   # Introduce syntax error in Python file
   # Save the file
   ```
   Expected: Logs show error message, server doesn't crash completely

8. Fix syntax error and save:
   Expected: Server auto-reloads successfully

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Backend restarts within 1-2 seconds of file change
- ✅ Logs show "Watching for file changes with watchdog"
- ✅ Works for .py files and templates
- ✅ Server recovers from syntax errors on fix
- ✅ No manual restart needed

   - Each service has color-coded prefix
   - Logs stream in real-time as services generate them

3. Test service-specific logs:
   ```bash
   # In one terminal
   ./docker-dev.sh logs backend
   ```
   Expected: Only backend logs visible

4. Generate backend activity:
   ```bash
   # In another terminal
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/
   ```
   Expected: Request appears in backend logs immediately

5. Test frontend logs:
   ```bash

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend HMR (Vite)
- File watching: Polling mode enabled (`usePolling: true`)
- Polling interval: 100ms
- HMR client port: 5173
- WebSocket connection for hot updates
- Bind mounts: src, public, config files

### Backend Auto-reload (Django)
- Django runserver with built-in autoreload
- Enhanced with watchdog library
- Monitors: .py, .html, .txt files
- PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 for immediate log output
- Bind mount: entire backend directory

### Dependency Management
- Frontend: Named volume for node_modules
- Backend: Virtual environment excluded from bind mount
- Persistence across restarts
- Installation via exec command

### Log Aggregation
- Docker Compose native aggregation
- JSON file driver with rotation
- Max size: 10MB per file
- Max files: 3 (30MB total per service)
- Color-coded service prefixes

## Known Limitations

1. **File watching on different host OS:**
   - Linux: Native file watching (fast)
   - Mac/Windows: Requires polling (configured, may be slower)

2. **Large projects:**
   - Many files may increase polling overhead
   - Adjust polling interval if needed

3. **Network file systems:**
   - May require additional configuration for file watching
   - Polling is more reliable than native watching

4. **Container resource limits:**
   - Heavy file watching can increase CPU usage
   - Monitor with: `docker stats`
