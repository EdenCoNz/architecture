# Feature #4: Automated Issue Creation for Failed Workflow Jobs

## Overview
Enable automatic tracking and reporting of workflow failures by detecting failed jobs, capturing execution context, and creating detailed tracking issues without manual intervention. This helps development teams quickly identify, triage, and resolve build failures while maintaining a complete audit trail of workflow issues.

## Missing Agents (if applicable)
None - the devops-engineer agent has the necessary capabilities for CI/CD automation and workflow orchestration.

## User Stories

### 1. Detect Workflow Job Failures
As a development team, we want the build system to automatically detect when any job in a workflow has failed, so that we can respond to issues without manually monitoring build status.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a workflow is running, when any job completes with a failure status, then the failure should be detected
- Given all jobs in a workflow succeed, when the workflow completes, then no failure detection should occur
- Given multiple jobs fail in a single workflow, when the workflow completes, then each failure should be detected independently

**Agent**: devops-engineer
**Dependencies**: none

### 2. Create Local Issue Log File from Template
As a development team, we want a structured log file created automatically when a failure is detected, so that we have a consistent format for capturing issue details.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a job failure is detected, when the issue logging process starts, then a local file should be created using the template structure
- Given the local file is created, when I inspect the filename, then it should include identifiers for the run, job, and step
- Given the template file exists in the templates directory, when the log file is created, then it should preserve the template structure with empty fields ready for population

### 3. Trigger Reusable Issue Creation Workflow
As a development team, we want the failure detection to automatically start a separate issue creation process, so that issue logging can be reused across different workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a local log file has been created, when the launcher completes, then a separate reusable workflow should be triggered
- Given the reusable workflow is triggered, when it starts, then it should receive the log filename as input
- Given the reusable workflow is triggered, when multiple workflows fail simultaneously, then each should trigger its own independent issue creation process

**Dependencies**: Story 2

### 4. Extract Workflow Execution Metadata
As a development team, we want the system to automatically retrieve run information, so that issues contain complete context about what failed and where.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a workflow run has failed, when metadata extraction occurs, then the run identifier should be retrieved
- Given a workflow run has failed, when metadata extraction occurs, then job name, step name, and execution URLs should be retrieved
- Given metadata extraction completes, when I review the extracted data, then it should include links to the pull request, commit, and workflow run

**Agent**: devops-engineer
**Dependencies**: Story 3

### 5. Populate Issue Log Template with Metadata
As a development team, we want the extracted run information automatically filled into the log template, so that issues contain structured, searchable data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given workflow metadata has been extracted, when the log file is populated, then all template fields should be filled with corresponding metadata values
- Given log line numbers indicate the failure location, when the log file is populated, then the relevant log excerpt should be included with context
- Given the log file is populated, when I open the file, then all fields should contain actual values with no empty placeholders

**Dependencies**: Story 4

### 6. Create Tracking Issue Automatically
As a development team, we want an issue automatically created in the issue tracker with the populated log details, so that failures are immediately visible and trackable without manual reporting.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the log file has been populated with metadata, when issue creation occurs, then a new issue should appear in the issue tracker
- Given an issue is created, when I view the issue, then it should contain the complete populated log file as the issue body
- Given an issue is created, when I search for issues, then it should be identifiable by the feature, job, and run information in the title or labels

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: devops-engineer)
- Story #2 (agent: devops-engineer) - depends on Story #1
- Story #3 (agent: devops-engineer) - depends on Story #2

### Phase 2 (Sequential)
- Story #4 (agent: devops-engineer) - depends on Story #3
- Story #5 (agent: devops-engineer) - depends on Story #4
- Story #6 (agent: devops-engineer) - depends on Story #5

## Notes

### Story Quality Guidelines
- All stories are implementation-agnostic (no specific CI/CD platform, tools, or technologies mentioned)
- All stories focus on WHAT the system should do from a team perspective, not HOW to implement it
- All stories are atomic (each delivers one complete capability, 1-3 days max)
- All acceptance criteria describe observable system behaviors and outcomes
- Stories work with any CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.)
