## User Stories

### 1. Design Test Page Interface
Design a simple test page interface that allows users to trigger API calls to the backend and view responses clearly.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Design includes a prominent action button for triggering API calls
- Design shows clear visual feedback for loading, success, and error states
- Design displays API response data in a readable format

Agent: ui-ux-designer
Dependencies: none

**Design Context**:
- Update docs/design-brief.md to incorporate design decisions for this feature
- If design-brief.md doesn't exist, create it with the foundational design system
- Add a feature-specific section under the "## Features" heading
- Include component specifications, interaction patterns, and all UI states
- Ensure consistency with existing design system (colors, typography, spacing)

**Important**: This story describes WHAT needs to be achieved using generic, technology-agnostic language. ALL implementation details (technology choices, frameworks, libraries, tools, file formats, patterns, architecture) MUST be decided by the assigned development agent based on project context and best practices. DO NOT include ANY specific technology references in this story.

### 2. Create Health Check API Endpoint
Implement a simple health check API endpoint that the frontend can call to verify backend connectivity and receive a basic response.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Backend exposes a health check endpoint accessible via HTTP
- Endpoint returns a successful response with status information
- Endpoint includes timestamp and service status in response payload

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: none

### 3. Implement Test Page Component
Create a test page that displays a button and shows the results of API calls, following the approved design specifications.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Test page accessible via client-side routing
- Page displays interactive button matching design specifications
- Page includes areas to display loading, success, and error states
- Page follows established design system and coding conventions

### 4. Configure Backend CORS for Frontend Access
Configure the backend to accept requests from the frontend application's origin, enabling cross-origin communication.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Backend accepts requests from frontend development server origin
- Backend accepts requests from frontend production origin
- Backend includes appropriate security headers in responses

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: 2

### 5. Implement API Service Layer for Backend Communication
Create a service layer in the frontend that handles HTTP communication with the backend API endpoints.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Service layer provides method to call health check endpoint
- Service layer handles network errors gracefully
- Service layer returns responses in a consistent format
- Service layer follows established coding conventions and patterns

---

### 6. Configure Environment Variables for API Connection
Set up environment configuration to specify backend API base URL for both development and production environments.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Frontend can read backend API URL from environment configuration
- Development environment points to local backend server
- Production environment configuration is documented for deployment
- Configuration changes don't require code modifications

### 7. Connect Button to Backend API Call
Wire the test page button to call the backend health check endpoint and display the response, demonstrating successful frontend-backend integration.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Clicking button triggers API call to backend health check endpoint
- Loading state displays while request is in progress
- Success response displays API data returned from backend
- Error state displays when API call fails with helpful error message
- All interactions follow accessibility standards
