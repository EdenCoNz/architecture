# Fix Issue #138: ESLint Errors in Dark Mode Feature

## Overview
The dark mode feature implementation has several code quality issues detected by ESLint during CI/CD pipeline execution. These issues include duplicate imports, code formatting inconsistencies, and TypeScript type safety warnings. Resolving these issues will ensure the codebase maintains consistent quality standards and passes automated quality gates.

## Missing Agents
None - all required agents are available.

## User Stories

### 1. Remove Duplicate Module Import
The theme context module imports from the same library multiple times, violating code organization standards. Users expect the application to follow consistent coding practices that prevent redundancy and potential maintenance issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When the theme context file is analyzed by code quality tools, then no duplicate import violations should be reported
- When developers review the theme context code, then they should see each module imported only once
- When the application runs, then all theme functionality should work exactly as before the change

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

---

### 2. Separate Component Exports from Utility Exports
The theme context module exports both components and utility functions together, which can interfere with development tools that automatically refresh components during development. Users expect smooth development experience without unnecessary page reloads.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When the theme context code is analyzed, then component exports should be properly separated from utility function exports
- When developers make changes to theme-related code during development, then hot module replacement should work correctly
- When the application theme functionality is tested, then all theme switching and persistence features should work as expected

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story 1

### 3. Standardize Code Formatting in Test Files
Test files contain inconsistent code formatting that deviates from the project's established style guide. Users expect consistent, readable code throughout the application that follows industry best practices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When test files are analyzed by code formatting tools, then no formatting violations should be reported
- When developers read test code, then formatting should be consistent with the project style guide
- When tests are executed, then all test cases should pass with identical functionality to before formatting changes

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

---

### 4. Improve Type Safety in Test Assertions
Test files use generic type assertions that bypass the type system's safety checks. Users expect robust test code that catches potential type-related issues early in the development process.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When test code is analyzed, then no type safety warnings should be reported by static analysis tools
- When theme configuration is tested, then type-safe assertions should verify component properties correctly
- When tests are executed, then all test cases should pass and verify the same behaviors as before

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

---

### 5. Verify Code Quality Standards Pass
After all code improvements are applied, the complete codebase should pass all automated quality checks. Users expect the application to meet all established quality gates before deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When the linting process runs in the CI/CD pipeline, then all files should pass without errors or warnings
- When code formatting is checked, then all files should comply with the project's formatting standards
- When the build process executes, then the application should compile successfully with no quality violations

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story 1, Story 2, Story 3, Story 4

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Parallel)
- Story 1 (agent: frontend-developer)
- Story 3 (agent: frontend-developer)
- Story 4 (agent: frontend-developer)

### Phase 2 (Sequential)
- Story 2 (agent: frontend-developer) - depends on Story 1

### Phase 3 (Sequential)
- Story 5 (agent: frontend-developer) - depends on all previous stories

## Notes

### Implementation Guidance
This is a FIX MODE task for issue #138. The user stories address ESLint and Prettier violations identified in the CI/CD pipeline:

**Files Affected**:
- /home/ed/Dev/architecture/frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx
- /home/ed/Dev/architecture/frontend/src/integration/ThemeToggle.integration.test.tsx
- /home/ed/Dev/architecture/frontend/src/pages/Home/Home.test.tsx
- /home/ed/Dev/architecture/frontend/src/theme/index.test.ts

**Specific Issues to Address**:
1. Duplicate 'react' import on line 10 of ThemeContext.tsx
2. react-refresh warning about mixing component and function exports on line 104
3. Prettier formatting issues in test files (multiline ternaries, expect statement formatting)
4. TypeScript explicit any warnings in theme test assertions

**Success Criteria**:
The implementation agent should ensure that running `npm run lint` produces zero errors and zero warnings in all affected files.

### Story Quality Guidelines
- Generic and implementation-agnostic (focused on code quality outcomes, not specific fixes)
- User-focused (describes impact on development experience and code maintainability)
- Atomic (each story addresses a distinct category of code quality issue)
- Testable (acceptance criteria verify observable outcomes through linting and testing)
