## User Stories

### 1. Design Dark Mode Theme System
Design a comprehensive dark mode color palette and theming specifications that maintain accessibility, visual hierarchy, and brand consistency. The design should include all UI states, component adaptations, and transition behaviors.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dark mode color palette defined with accessibility-compliant contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- All UI component states specified for dark theme (default, hover, active, disabled)
- Design documentation updated in design brief with dark mode specifications

Agent: ui-ux-designer
Dependencies: none

**Design Context**:
- Update docs/design-brief.md to incorporate design decisions for this feature
- Add a "Dark Mode Theme System" section under the "## Features" heading
- Include dark mode color palette, component specifications for dark variants, and transition patterns
- Define how existing components (AppBar, Cards, Buttons, etc.) adapt to dark mode
- Ensure consistency with existing light mode design system
- Specify surface elevation colors for dark mode (Material Design 3 elevation overlay pattern)

### 2. Store User Theme Preference
Enable the system to persist user theme preference (light or dark mode) so that the choice is remembered across sessions and devices.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User theme preference is stored persistently
- Theme preference is retrieved on application load
- Theme preference persists across browser sessions

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: none

### 3. Implement Theme Switching System
Build the core theme switching functionality that allows the application to dynamically switch between light and dark modes based on user preference.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Application dynamically switches between light and dark themes
- Theme change applies immediately to all components
- System respects stored user preference on application load

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: 1, 2

### 4. Create Theme Toggle Control
Build a user interface control that allows users to manually switch between light and dark modes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Toggle control is accessible from application navigation
- Toggle control clearly indicates current theme state
- Toggle control follows established design system and accessibility guidelines

### 5. Detect System Theme Preference
Enable the application to automatically detect and respect the user's operating system theme preference on first visit.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Application detects operating system theme preference
- Default theme matches system preference for new users
- User can override system preference with manual toggle

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: 3

### 6. Test Theme Switching Across All Pages
Verify that theme switching works consistently across all existing application pages and components.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All existing pages render correctly in both light and dark themes
- All existing components display properly in both themes
- Theme transitions are smooth without visual glitches
