## Notes

### Story Quality Validation
- All stories are implementation-agnostic (no frameworks or technologies specified)
- All stories focus on user-observable behavior and WHAT needs to be achieved
- Each story delivers independent, testable value
- Acceptance criteria describe what users SEE, DO, or EXPERIENCE
- No technical implementation details included (no mention of CSS variables, localStorage, React context, etc.)

### Atomicity Compliance
- Each story can be completed in 1-3 days
- Stories have 3-4 acceptance criteria maximum
- Each story delivers ONE complete user-facing capability
- Stories are split logically: design (2) + default theme (1) + dark theme (1) + toggle UI (1) + toggle functionality (1) + persistence (1)

### Design-Implementation Separation
- Design stories (1-2) are assigned to ui-ux-designer and run first
- Implementation stories (3-7) depend on design completion
- This ensures visual consistency before technical implementation

### User Value Focus
- Story #3-4: Users can see the application in both themes
- Story #5-6: Users can control which theme they prefer
- Story #7: Users don't need to re-select their preference repeatedly
