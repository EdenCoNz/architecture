# Bug Fix User Stories: GitHub Issue #54

**Feature ID**: 6
**Feature Name**: dark-mode-light-mode-toggle
**Bug ID**: github-issue-54
**Bug Title**: [feature/6-dark-mode-light-mode-toggle] lint job failed
**Severity**: Medium
**Created**: 2025-10-20

## Bug Summary

The CI/CD pipeline lint job failed on the feature/6-dark-mode-light-mode-toggle branch due to an import sorting violation detected by Ruff linter (rule I001). The test file `tests/integration/api/preferences/test_theme_endpoints.py` has imports that are not properly sorted according to Python import conventions (PEP 8 / isort).

### Root Cause Analysis

The Ruff linter with isort enabled expects imports to be organized in the following order:
1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports (e.g., pytest, django, rest_framework)
3. First-party imports (e.g., apps.preferences.models)

Within each group, imports should be alphabetically sorted with a blank line separating groups.

**Current Import Order (Incorrect)**:
```python
import pytest
from apps.preferences.models import UserPreferences
from django.urls import reverse
from rest_framework import status
```

**Expected Import Order (Correct)**:
```python
import pytest
from django.urls import reverse
from rest_framework import status

from apps.preferences.models import UserPreferences
```

### Impact
- CI/CD pipeline blocked (lint job failing)
- Cannot merge PR until linting passes
- Affects feature #6 delivery timeline

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: backend-developer) - Must complete first to fix the violation

### Phase 2 (Parallel)
- Story #2 (agent: backend-developer) - Validates the fix
- Story #3 (agent: devops-engineer) - Prevents future violations

## User Stories

### 1. Fix Import Sorting Violation

Correct the import ordering in the test file to comply with code quality standards. The imports must follow proper grouping conventions with standard library imports first, followed by third-party imports, and finally first-party project imports. Each group should be alphabetically sorted with appropriate spacing between groups.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Import statements follow proper grouping order (standard library, third-party, first-party)
- Imports within each group are alphabetically sorted
- Code quality checks pass without import sorting violations

**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

**Important**: This story describes WHAT needs to be achieved using generic, technology-agnostic language. ALL implementation details (technology choices, frameworks, libraries, tools, file formats, patterns, architecture) MUST be decided by the assigned development agent based on project context and best practices. DO NOT include ANY specific technology references in this story.

---

### 2. Validate Import Sorting Fix

Verify that the import sorting fix resolves the linting failure and doesn't introduce any regressions in the codebase or test suite. All quality checks must pass and existing functionality must remain intact.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Linting checks pass successfully without import violations
- All existing tests continue to pass without errors
- Code quality pipeline completes successfully without failures

### 3. Prevent Future Import Sorting Violations

Add automated import sorting to the development workflow to prevent similar violations from occurring in the future. This includes configuring automated tools and updating developer documentation with clear guidelines.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Import sorting runs automatically during code formatting workflow
- Developer documentation updated with import sorting guidelines and examples
- Pre-commit hooks configured to catch and fix import violations before CI/CD

## Testing Strategy

### Story #1: Fix Import Sorting Violation
- **TDD Approach**: Run linting checks before and after fix to verify resolution
- **Validation**: Confirm linter passes with 0 import sorting violations
- **Regression**: Ensure imports still resolve correctly and tests run

### Story #2: Validate Import Sorting Fix
- **TDD Approach**: Run full test suite and linting pipeline
- **Validation**: All CI/CD checks must pass (lint, test, build)
- **Regression**: Verify no existing tests broken by import reordering

### Story #3: Prevent Future Import Sorting Violations
- **TDD Approach**: Intentionally create unsorted imports to verify hooks catch them
- **Validation**: Pre-commit hook auto-fixes import violations
- **Regression**: Ensure hook doesn't break existing development workflow

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All import sorting violations resolved
- ✅ CI/CD lint job passes successfully
- ✅ All tests continue to pass
- ✅ PR can be merged without linting failures
- ✅ Automated import sorting in place for future development
- ✅ Developer documentation updated with import conventions

- The fix is purely formatting-related and should not affect functionality
- Import sorting automation (Story #3) will prevent this class of issue from recurring
- All stories follow TDD methodology with clear validation steps
