# Bug Fix User Stories: GitHub Issue #40
## TypeScript Type Check Failed - Unused Import Detected

**Bug ID**: github-issue-40
**Feature ID**: 6
**GitHub Issue**: #40
**GitHub PR**: #39
**Severity**: Medium

## Bug Description

The CI/CD pipeline TypeScript type check step failed with error:
```
error TS6133: 'within' is declared but its value is never read.
```

**Context**:
- File: `frontend/src/test/integration/theme-switching.test.tsx`
- Line: 15
- Issue: Unused import `within` from `@testing-library/react`
- TypeScript Config: `noUnusedLocals: true` enforces strict unused variable checking

**Impact**:
- Blocks PR #39 from being merged
- Prevents Feature 6 (Dark Mode/Light Mode Toggle) deployment
- CI/CD pipeline fails at type check stage
- Violates code quality standards

## User Stories

### 1. Identify Unused Imports in Test File
Analyze the theme switching integration test file to identify all declared imports and determine which are actively used versus unused. Document findings to ensure the fix addresses all code quality issues.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All imports in test file are reviewed and categorized as used or unused
- Root cause of type check failure is confirmed
- List of unused imports is documented for remediation

Agent: frontend-developer
Dependencies: none

ALL implementation details (technology choices, frameworks, libraries, tools, file formats, patterns, architecture) MUST be decided by the assigned development agent based on project context and best practices. DO NOT include ANY specific technology references in this story.

### 2. Remove Unused Import from Test File
Remove the unused import declaration from the theme switching integration test file. Ensure the file maintains correct functionality and all existing tests continue to pass.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Unused import statement is removed from test file
- Test file syntax remains valid after removal
- All existing test cases execute successfully without errors

### 3. Validate CI/CD Pipeline Type Check Passes
Verify that the type checking step in the automated pipeline completes successfully after the unused import fix. Confirm all pipeline quality gates pass without errors.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Type checking step completes without unused variable errors
- All other pipeline quality checks continue to pass
- Pipeline execution completes successfully end-to-end

## Notes

### TDD Approach
This bug fix follows a validation-first approach:
1. **Story #1**: Investigation and documentation (understand the problem)
2. **Story #2**: Implementation of fix (solve the problem)
3. **Story #3**: Validation (verify the solution works in CI/CD context)

### Prevention
Consider adding linting rules or pre-commit hooks to catch unused imports before code reaches CI/CD pipeline. This could be addressed in a separate feature for improving development workflow.
