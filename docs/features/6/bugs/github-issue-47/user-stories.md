## User Stories

### 1. Investigate CI/CD Failure Root Causes
Analyze the failed CI/CD pipeline run to identify all root causes across lint, format, and test jobs. Document specific violations, affected files, and understand why each job failed.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All linting violations identified and documented with file locations and line numbers
- All formatting violations identified and documented
- All test failures analyzed and root causes documented

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: none

### 2. Fix Code Linting Violations
Remove unused imports and resolve all linting violations identified in the preferences module. Ensure code passes all linting checks without introducing new issues.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All unused imports removed from affected source files
- Code passes linting validation without errors
- No new linting violations introduced

### 3. Fix Code Formatting Violations
Resolve all code formatting violations to ensure code follows established formatting standards and passes formatting checks.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All formatting violations corrected in affected files
- Code passes formatting validation without errors
- Formatting changes maintain code readability and consistency

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: 1

---

### 4. Fix Test Suite Failures
Resolve all test failures identified in the test job. Ensure tests pass reliably and validate expected functionality.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All failing tests analyzed and fixed
- Test suite passes completely without errors
- Test fixes maintain or improve test coverage

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: 2, 3

### 5. Validate Complete CI/CD Pipeline Success
Run the complete CI/CD pipeline to verify all jobs (lint, format, type-check, test, security) pass successfully after fixes are applied.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All CI/CD pipeline jobs complete successfully
- No remaining errors or warnings in any job
- Pipeline validates code is ready for merge

---

### 6. Add Pre-Commit Quality Checks
Configure automated pre-commit hooks that run code quality checks before commits are made. This prevents code quality violations from reaching the CI/CD pipeline.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Pre-commit hooks installed and configured for linting and formatting
- Hooks run automatically before each commit
- Hooks prevent commits when quality checks fail

### 7. Create Code Quality Regression Test Suite
Build automated regression tests that validate code quality standards are maintained. Tests should detect common violations like unused imports, formatting issues, and style inconsistencies.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Regression tests detect unused imports in source code
- Regression tests validate formatting compliance
- Tests run as part of continuous integration pipeline
