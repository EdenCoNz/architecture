# Bug Fix #github-issue-41: Lint job failed - code quality issues detected

## Bug Context
- **Feature**: #6 - Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle
- **GitHub Issue**: #41
- **Severity**: High
- **Type**: CI/CD Pipeline Failure
- **Root Cause**: Code formatting and linting violations introduced during feature implementation

## Root Cause Analysis
The CI/CD "Lint and Format Check" job failed with 26 problems (18 errors, 8 warnings):

1. **Formatting Violations (18 errors)**: Prettier formatting inconsistencies in integration test files
   - `mui-components-theme.test.tsx`: Indentation and line break issues
   - `theme-switching.test.tsx`: Button text formatting

2. **Type Safety Warnings (6 warnings)**: Explicit "any" type usage in test assertions
   - `themeSlice.test.ts`: Multiple instances of `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`

3. **Component Export Warnings (2 warnings)**: Hot module replacement best practice violations
   - `ThemeContext.tsx`: Fast refresh export pattern warning
   - `test-utils.tsx`: Export pattern verification warning

All formatting errors are auto-fixable with linting tool fix command.

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Parallel)

## User Stories

### 1. Fix Code Formatting Violations
Resolve all code formatting violations detected by the linting tool to ensure code quality standards are met and the build pipeline succeeds.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All formatting errors in test files are corrected according to project formatting rules
- Code passes format validation checks without errors
- Formatting is consistent across all modified files
