# User Stories: Bug Fix for GitHub Issue #10

**Bug ID**: github-issue-10
**Feature**: #2 - Dockerize Frontend Application
**GitHub Issue**: [#10](https://github.com/EdenCoNz/architecture/issues/10)
**Title**: Docker build or test failed - container issues detected
**Severity**: High
**Created**: 2025-10-18T01:42:46Z

## Bug Summary

The CI/CD pipeline is failing during Docker container testing. The health check endpoint (`/health`) passes successfully, but the application root endpoint (`/`) fails to return valid HTML content. This indicates that while nginx is running and responding to health checks, it is not correctly serving the built React application files.

### Failure Context
- **Job**: Build and Test Docker Image
- **Failed Step**: Test application root
- **PR**: [#8](https://github.com/EdenCoNz/architecture/pull/8)
- **Workflow Run**: [18608895471](https://github.com/EdenCoNz/architecture/actions/runs/18608895471)
- **Error**: Application root did not respond with valid HTML (health check passed)

### Root Cause Hypothesis
1. The nginx `/health` endpoint works (defined in nginx.conf line 72-76)
2. The application root `/` is not serving HTML correctly
3. Possible causes:
   - Build artifacts (dist/) not being copied correctly in Dockerfile
   - Nginx configuration issue with SPA routing
   - index.html missing or corrupted in the build
   - File permissions issue in the container

## User Stories

### 1. Investigate Docker Container Root Cause Failure
Investigate why the Docker container's application root endpoint is failing to serve HTML while the health check endpoint passes. This story focuses on reproducing the issue locally and identifying the exact root cause through systematic debugging.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Reproduce the CI/CD failure locally by building and running the Docker image
- Verify that `/health` endpoint returns "healthy" response
- Confirm that `/` endpoint fails to return valid HTML (reproducing the bug)
- Inspect container logs to identify error messages or warnings
- Examine the contents of `/usr/share/nginx/html` inside the running container
- Verify that `dist/index.html` exists after the build stage completes
- Test nginx configuration syntax inside the container (`nginx -t`)
- Document specific root cause findings in investigation notes

### 2. Write Regression Test for Docker Container Endpoints
Create automated tests that verify both the health endpoint and application root endpoint respond correctly. These tests will prevent this regression from occurring again and will run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Create test script that validates `/health` endpoint returns 200 status and "healthy" text
- Add test that validates `/` endpoint returns 200 status and HTML with DOCTYPE
- Add test that verifies HTML contains expected React app div (id="root")
- Test script should fail fast with clear error messages indicating which endpoint failed
- Tests should be executable both locally and in CI/CD environment
- Document how to run tests locally in docker-guide.md or README

Dependencies: Story #1

### 3. Implement Fix for Docker Container Root Endpoint
Based on the root cause identified in Story #1, implement the fix to ensure the application root endpoint correctly serves the React application HTML. This may involve fixing the Dockerfile, nginx configuration, or build process.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Application root endpoint (`/`) returns valid HTML with DOCTYPE declaration
- HTML response includes the React app root div element
- Health check endpoint (`/health`) continues to work correctly
- Docker build completes successfully without errors
- Container starts successfully and serves content within 5 seconds
- All file permissions are correctly set for nginx user
- Changes are minimal and focused only on the root cause

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #2

---

### 4. Validate Fix Locally with Full Docker Workflow
Execute comprehensive local testing to validate that the fix resolves the issue across the complete Docker workflow including build, run, health check, and application serving.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Docker image builds successfully with `docker build` command
- Container starts successfully with `docker run -d -p 8080:8080`
- Health check endpoint returns "healthy" within 10 seconds
- Application root endpoint returns valid HTML within 10 seconds
- HTML content includes React application structure
- Run regression tests from Story #2 and verify all pass
- Verify nginx logs show no errors or warnings
- Test both fresh build and cached build scenarios

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #3

---

### 5. Verify CI/CD Pipeline Passes End-to-End
Push the fix to the PR branch and verify that the entire CI/CD pipeline passes, including the previously failing "Test application root" step. Ensure no other jobs were negatively impacted by the changes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Lint and Format Check job passes
- TypeScript Type Check job passes
- Build Application job passes and uploads artifacts
- Security Audit job passes
- Build and Test Docker Image job passes completely
- "Test health endpoint" step passes
- "Test application root" step passes (previously failing)
- Docker build summary shows successful image creation
- All tests complete within expected timeout windows
- No new warnings or errors introduced in any job

## Notes

### Testing Strategy
This bug fix follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology:
1. Story #1: Investigate and reproduce the failure
2. Story #2: Write regression tests that currently fail
3. Story #3: Implement the fix to make tests pass
4. Story #4: Validate locally with comprehensive testing
5. Story #5: Validate in CI/CD environment

### Investigation Checklist
When working on Story #1, systematically check:
- [ ] Docker build logs for any errors or warnings
- [ ] Contents of `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory in running container
- [ ] File permissions on all files in `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- [ ] Nginx configuration syntax (`nginx -t`)
- [ ] Nginx access and error logs
- [ ] Build stage output (verify dist/ directory has index.html)
- [ ] Dockerfile COPY commands are correct
- [ ] User/group ownership of nginx files

### Potential Root Causes (To Verify)
1. **Missing index.html**: Build stage may not be creating index.html correctly
2. **COPY path mismatch**: Dockerfile may be copying from wrong path or to wrong destination
3. **Permissions issue**: nginx user may not have read permissions on HTML files
4. **Nginx config error**: Location blocks may not be configured correctly for SPA routing
5. **Build artifact issue**: Vite build may be failing silently or producing invalid output

### Expected Outcome
After all stories are complete:
- Docker container serves React application correctly at `/` endpoint
- Health check endpoint continues to work at `/health` endpoint
- CI/CD pipeline passes completely with no failures
- Regression tests prevent this issue from recurring
- Documentation is updated with any learnings or troubleshooting steps
