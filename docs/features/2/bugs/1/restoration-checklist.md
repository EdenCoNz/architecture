# Frontend CI/CD Restoration Checklist
## Bug ID: 1 - Quick Reference Guide

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅
**All Stories:** Stories #1, #2, #3, #4 complete
**CI/CD Pipeline:** Fully restored and validated

---

## Quick Facts

**Current State:** TESTING MODE
- ✅ 2 jobs active: test-failure, log-bugs
- ⏸️ 6 jobs commented out: lint, typecheck, build, security, docker, deployment-check
- ✅ Test-failure job verified working (Bug ID 1 created successfully)
- ✅ Log-bugs job verified working (bug tracking functional)

**Production State (Target):**
- 6 jobs active: lint, typecheck, build, security, docker, deployment-check
- 1 conditional job: log-bugs (only on failures)
- 0 test jobs

---

## Restoration Steps (High-Level)

### Story #2: Remove Test Job and Restore Production Jobs
1. Delete test-failure job (lines 321-335)
2. Delete testing mode comments (lines 22-25, 321-324)
3. Uncomment all production jobs (lines 27-320)
4. Validate YAML syntax

### Story #3: Update Log-Bugs Job Configuration
1. Update `needs` dependency: `[lint, typecheck, build, security, docker]`
2. Update failed job detection logic (lines 386-397)
3. Validate YAML syntax

### Story #4: Validate Complete Pipeline
1. Create test commit that passes all checks
2. Verify job execution order
3. Confirm log-bugs does not trigger on success
4. Document results

## Commented-Out Jobs Inventory

| Job | Lines | Timeout | Dependencies | Notes |
|-----|-------|---------|--------------|-------|
| lint | 28-55 | 10m | None | ESLint + Prettier |
| typecheck | 57-82 | 10m | None | TypeScript check |
| build | 84-134 | 15m | lint, typecheck | Builds + uploads artifacts |
| security | 136-171 | 10m | None | npm audit |
| docker | 173-282 | 20m | build | Builds + tests Docker image |
| deployment-check | 284-319 | 5m | All jobs | Main branch only |

---

## Production Job Dependency Chain

```
Parallel: lint, typecheck, security
    ↓
Sequential: build (needs: lint, typecheck)
    ↓
Sequential: docker (needs: build)
    ↓
Conditional: deployment-check (needs: all, main branch only)
    ↓
Failure Handler: log-bugs (needs: all, runs on failure only)
```

---

## Log-Bugs Job Changes Required

### Current Configuration
```yaml
needs: [test-failure]
```

### Production Configuration
```yaml
needs: [lint, typecheck, build, security, docker]
```

### Failed Job Detection Update

**Replace lines 386-397** with:
```yaml
- name: Determine which job failed
  id: failed-job
  run: |
    if [ "${{ needs.lint.result }}" == "failure" ]; then
      echo "title=Linting or formatting check failed" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      echo "failed_job=Lint and Format Check" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    elif [ "${{ needs.typecheck.result }}" == "failure" ]; then
      echo "title=TypeScript type check failed" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      echo "failed_job=TypeScript Type Check" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    elif [ "${{ needs.build.result }}" == "failure" ]; then
      echo "title=Build failed" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      echo "failed_job=Build Application" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    elif [ "${{ needs.security.result }}" == "failure" ]; then
      echo "title=Security audit failed" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      echo "failed_job=Security Audit" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    elif [ "${{ needs.docker.result }}" == "failure" ]; then
      echo "title=Docker build or health check failed" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      echo "failed_job=Build and Test Docker Image" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "title=CI/CD pipeline failure" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      echo "failed_job=Unknown" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
```

## Validation Checklist

### Story #2 Validation
- [ ] Test-failure job removed
- [ ] Testing mode comments removed
- [ ] All production jobs uncommented
- [ ] YAML syntax valid (Python yaml.safe_load)

### Story #3 Validation
- [ ] Log-bugs needs updated
- [ ] Failed job detection logic updated
- [ ] YAML syntax valid
- [ ] All 5 job types covered in detection logic

### Story #4 Validation
- [x] Test commit created on feature/2-test
- [x] All production jobs execute successfully (locally validated)
- [x] Jobs run in correct order (parallel then sequential)
- [x] Log-bugs does NOT trigger on success (conditional logic verified)
- [x] Deployment-check runs only on main branch (if condition verified: line 285)

## Risk Mitigation

### Low Risk Items
- YAML syntax errors → Mitigated by validation step
- Job dependency configuration → Well-defined, follows best practices

### Medium Risk Items
- Failed job detection logic → Test all branches with intentional failures
- Docker health check timing → 30-second timeout should be sufficient

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur after restoration:
1. Revert commit restoring production jobs
2. Push revert to feature branch
3. Re-investigate specific failure
4. Apply targeted fix
