# User Stories: Bug #1 - Test failure job failed - simulated test failure

**Bug ID:** 1
**Feature ID:** 2
**Title:** Test failure job failed - simulated test failure
**Severity:** Not specified
**Created:** 2025-10-17

## Root Cause Analysis

The CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`) contains a test job (`test-failure`) that is intentionally designed to always fail to test the bug logging system. This test job is blocking the actual CI/CD pipeline from functioning properly. The workflow has all production jobs commented out (lint, typecheck, build, security, docker, deployment-check) and only the test-failure job is active, causing every PR to fail.

The proper fix requires:
1. Removing the test-failure job
2. Restoring all production CI/CD jobs
3. Updating the log-bugs job to depend on production jobs with proper failure conditions
4. Validating the complete CI/CD pipeline works end-to-end

## User Stories

### 1. Investigate and Document Current Workflow State

Analyze the current CI/CD workflow configuration to understand all components, document the test mode setup, and identify all changes needed to restore production functionality.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Document all commented-out jobs and their dependencies in the workflow
- Verify the test-failure job behavior and its integration with log-bugs job
- Create a detailed plan for restoring production jobs with correct dependency chain
- Identify any configuration changes needed for log-bugs job to work with production jobs

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: none

### 2. Remove Test Failure Job and Restore Production Jobs

Remove the test-failure job from the CI/CD workflow and uncomment all production jobs (lint, typecheck, build, security, docker, deployment-check) to restore the full CI/CD pipeline.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Test-failure job and all testing mode comments are completely removed from workflow file
- All production jobs (lint, typecheck, build, security, docker, deployment-check) are uncommented and active
- Job dependencies are correctly configured (build needs lint and typecheck, docker needs build, etc.)
- Workflow file syntax is valid YAML with no parsing errors

Dependencies: Story #1

### 3. Update Log-Bugs Job Configuration

Update the log-bugs job to work with production jobs by configuring proper dependencies and failure conditions to only trigger when actual CI/CD jobs fail on feature branch PRs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Log-bugs job depends on all production jobs: [lint, typecheck, build, security, docker]
- Log-bugs job condition correctly checks: failure() && github.event_name == 'pull_request' && startsWith(github.head_ref, 'feature/')
- Log-bugs job has correct permissions (contents: write, actions: read) maintained
- Failed job detection logic updated to identify which production job failed (lint, typecheck, build, security, or docker)

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #2

---

### 4. Validate Complete CI/CD Pipeline End-to-End

Validate that the restored CI/CD pipeline works correctly by testing successful runs, intentional failures, and bug logging functionality across all job types.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a test commit on feature/2-test branch that passes all CI checks (lint, typecheck, build, security, docker)
- Verify all production jobs execute successfully and in correct order
- Document that the workflow completes without triggering log-bugs job on success
- Confirm deployment-check job is configured to run only on main branch pushes (not on this feature branch PR)

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #3

## Story Refinement Summary

- Initial stories created: 5
- Stories after atomicity refinement: 4
- Stories split: 1 (combined "Write regression tests" with validation story as they test the same end-to-end behavior)
- Average acceptance criteria per story: 4

## Notes

- All stories follow TDD methodology with testable acceptance criteria
- Each story is independently deployable and focuses on a single aspect of the fix
- Story #4 provides comprehensive end-to-end validation that serves as regression testing
- The investigation story (#1) ensures thorough understanding before making changes
- Dependencies are sequential to ensure proper workflow restoration progression
