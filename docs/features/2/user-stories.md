## User Stories

### 1. Add Unit Test Job to GitHub Workflow
Add a dedicated unit test job to the existing frontend-ci.yml workflow that runs the Vitest test suite in parallel with other checks to ensure code quality and catch regressions early.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A new "test" job is added to .github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml that runs npm run test:run
- Job runs in parallel with lint and typecheck jobs (not dependent on them)
- Job has appropriate timeout (10 minutes) and runs on ubuntu-22.04
- Test failures cause the workflow to fail and block merging

Dependencies: none

### 2. Add Test Coverage Reporting to GitHub Workflow
Extend the test job to generate and upload test coverage reports, providing visibility into code coverage metrics and trends over time.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Test job runs npm run test:coverage to generate coverage reports
- Coverage artifacts are uploaded using actions/upload-artifact@v4 with appropriate retention
- Coverage summary is added to GitHub Step Summary showing overall coverage percentage
- Coverage reports are available for download from workflow run artifacts

### 3. Add Test Coverage Comments to Pull Requests
Implement automated test coverage reporting as PR comments to provide immediate feedback on coverage changes without leaving the PR interface.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Coverage report is posted as a comment on pull requests showing coverage metrics
- Comment includes overall coverage percentage and file-level breakdown
- Comment updates on subsequent commits (not creating duplicate comments)
- Uses a GitHub Action like romeovs/lcov-reporter-action or similar

### 4. Add Build Status Badge to Frontend README
Add workflow status badge to the frontend README.md to provide immediate visibility of CI/CD pipeline health.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GitHub Actions badge is added to frontend/README.md showing workflow status
- Badge displays current status of frontend-ci.yml workflow
- Badge is positioned prominently near the top of README
- Badge correctly links to the workflow runs page
