# Feature 2: Dockerize Frontend Application

## Overview
Dockerize the React frontend application to ensure consistent development and production environments. This includes creating multi-stage Docker builds, optimizing for production, integrating with local development workflows, and updating CI/CD to build and verify Docker images.

- Story 1 (agent: devops-engineer) - Foundation for all Docker work

### Phase 2 (Sequential)
- Story 2 (agent: devops-engineer) - Depends on Story 1

### Phase 3 (Sequential)
- Story 3 (agent: devops-engineer) - Depends on Story 2

### Phase 4 (Parallel)
- Story 4 (agent: devops-engineer) - Depends on Story 3
- Story 5 (agent: devops-engineer) - Depends on Story 3

### Phase 5 (Sequential)
- Story 6 (agent: devops-engineer) - Depends on Stories 4 and 5

### Phase 6 (Sequential)
- Story 7 (agent: devops-engineer) - Depends on Story 6

## User Stories

### 1. Create Multi-Stage Dockerfile for Frontend
Create a production-ready, multi-stage Dockerfile for the React frontend application that optimizes build performance and minimizes final image size.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dockerfile includes separate build stage using Node 20 Alpine that runs npm ci, npm run build
- Final production stage uses nginx:alpine, copies dist/ artifacts from build stage
- nginx.conf configured to serve single-page application with proper routing fallback
- Image build completes successfully and final image size is under 50MB

Dependencies: none

### 2. Create Docker Ignore File
Create .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files from Docker build context, improving build performance and security.

Acceptance Criteria:
- .dockerignore excludes node_modules, dist, coverage, .git, tests, and development files
- Docker build context size reduced by at least 80% compared to no .dockerignore
- Build performance improves measurably (timing comparison documented)

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story 1

---

### 3. Create Docker Compose Configuration for Local Development
Create docker-compose.yml that enables developers to run the frontend application locally using Docker with hot reload support.

Acceptance Criteria:
- docker-compose.yml defines frontend service with volume mounts for src/ directory
- Development mode uses Vite dev server (port 5173) with hot module replacement working
- Environment variables configurable via .env file support
- README.md updated with docker-compose commands (up, down, logs)

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story 2

---

### 4. Add Docker Build Scripts to Package.json
Add npm scripts to package.json for common Docker operations to standardize developer workflows.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Scripts added: docker:build, docker:run, docker:stop
- Scripts work correctly and use appropriate Docker commands
- Scripts documented in frontend/README.md with usage examples

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story 3

---

### 5. Create Development Dockerfile
Create Dockerfile.dev specifically for local development that mirrors production environment but includes development tooling.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dockerfile.dev uses Node 20 Alpine with development dependencies
- Runs Vite dev server with volume mounts for live code updates
- Includes debugging tools and healthcheck configuration
- docker-compose.yml references Dockerfile.dev for development mode

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story 3

---

### 6. Integrate Docker Build into CI/CD Pipeline
Update GitHub Actions workflow to build Docker image, verify it works, and optionally push to container registry.

Acceptance Criteria:
- New job added to frontend-ci.yml that builds Docker image after build job succeeds
- Docker image tagged with git commit SHA and 'latest' tag
- Image tested by running container and checking health endpoint responds
- Build fails if Docker image build fails or container health check fails

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Stories 4, 5

---

### 7. Create Docker Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation for Docker usage covering both development and production scenarios.

Acceptance Criteria:
- docs/features/2/docker-guide.md created with architecture overview, build instructions, troubleshooting
- Frontend README.md Docker section expanded with quick start guide
- Documentation covers environment variable configuration, volume mounts, networking
- Production deployment guidance included with security best practices

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story 6
