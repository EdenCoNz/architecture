All 10 user stories completed successfully with comprehensive testing and documentation. The tech stack selection prioritized developer experience (Vite's fast HMR), type safety (TypeScript), code quality (ESLint/Prettier), and maintainability (Material UI design system). The project demonstrates modern best practices: TDD with Vitest, component-driven architecture, strict typing, automated CI/CD, comprehensive documentation, and accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA). The directory structure uses feature-based organization with barrel exports for scalability.",

        "Use Material UI theme system consistently for all styling (sx prop, styled API)",
        "Maintain 80%+ test coverage target established in documentation",
        "Follow established file naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)",
        "Add new routes following the pages/ directory structure with proper TypeScript types",
        "Update design-brief.md when adding new design patterns or component specifications",
