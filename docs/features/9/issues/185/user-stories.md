# Fix User Stories for Issue #185

## Issue Overview
- **Issue Number**: #185
- **Issue Title**: Workflow Run #63 Failed: Backend CI/CD (0 failure(s))
- **Feature ID**: 9
- **Branch**: feature/9-docker-cicd-validation
- **Created**: 2025-10-25

## Problem Summary
The Backend CI/CD pipeline's production container functional testing is failing because API endpoint tests are executing before the container health check verification completes. This prevents validation that the production backend container is functioning correctly, blocking deployment validation.

## Root Cause
Workflow step ordering issue: The "Test API health endpoint" step runs immediately after container startup (after only 10 seconds), but the health check verification step (which waits up to 60 seconds for "healthy" status) should complete first. The API test attempts to verify the endpoint while the container is still in "starting" state, causing test failures.

### Story-185.1: Container Health Check Verification Before Testing

**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** the CI/CD pipeline to wait for container health checks to complete before running functional tests
**So that** functional tests only execute against fully initialized and ready containers

**Agent**: devops-engineer

**Description**:
The CI/CD workflow must ensure that production containers reach a "healthy" state before any functional tests are executed. This prevents tests from running against containers that are still initializing, which causes false failures and blocks the validation pipeline.

The workflow should verify that health checks pass completely (container status transitions from "starting" to "healthy") before proceeding to test individual API endpoints or functionality. This ensures tests run against fully operational containers.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Health Check Completion First**
   - Given the production backend container has started
   - When the workflow executes
   - Then the health check verification step must complete successfully (container reaches "healthy" status) before any API endpoint tests begin

2. **Test Execution After Ready State**
   - Given the container health check verification has completed
   - When functional tests begin execution
   - Then the container status should be "healthy" and all API endpoints should be responsive

3. **Clear Step Dependencies**
   - Given the workflow execution order
   - When reviewing the workflow logs
   - Then the health check verification step should show completion timestamps that occur before API testing steps begin

4. **Proper Wait Time Allocation**
   - Given the container is starting up
   - When the health check verification runs
   - Then it should wait for the full configured duration (up to 60 seconds) for the container to reach "healthy" state before declaring failure or proceeding

**Technical Reference**:
- Current issue: API test step runs at container start + 10 seconds
- Health check shows "starting (attempt 1/20)" when tests begin
- Database Connectivity Test and subsequent API tests start only 3 seconds into health check verification loop
- Expected: Health check verification completes → container reaches "healthy" → then tests execute

- ✅ No code structure prescribed
- ✅ Focus on observable behavior and outcomes

## Notes

This is a single atomic story because the issue has one clear root cause: workflow step ordering. The health check verification must complete before functional tests run. This is a straightforward DevOps workflow configuration fix that should take less than a day to implement and validate.

The story is written from the perspective of ensuring container readiness validation, which is a critical operational requirement for deployment confidence. The acceptance criteria focus on observable workflow behavior and container states, not on specific GitHub Actions syntax or implementation details.
