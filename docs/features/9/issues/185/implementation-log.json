    "technicalNotes": [
      "The fix changes workflow behavior from 'warn and continue' to 'fail fast' when health checks don't pass",
      "This ensures functional tests only run against fully initialized containers",
      "Container logs are now output on health check failure to aid in debugging",
      "The 60-second timeout (20 retries × 3 seconds) should be sufficient for Django application initialization with database migrations"
