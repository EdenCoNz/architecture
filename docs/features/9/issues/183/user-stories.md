# Feature #9 - Issue #183: Backend CI/CD Container Startup Failure

## Overview
The backend production container fails to start during deployment health checks due to an API documentation configuration warning that prevents the application from initializing. The frontend configuration endpoint needs proper API documentation schema configuration so that automated API documentation generation tools can correctly process the endpoint and allow the production container to start successfully.

### Story-183.1: Configure API Documentation for Frontend Configuration Endpoint

As a platform operator, I want the backend production container to start successfully with all API endpoints properly configured for documentation generation, so that the application can be deployed and made available to users without startup failures.

The frontend configuration endpoint currently lacks proper schema configuration for the API documentation system, which causes the production container to fail during startup validation. The endpoint needs to be configured so that the documentation system can correctly process it while maintaining the endpoint's functionality and behavior.

**Product Owner Context**:
- The production deployment system performs health checks during container startup
- These health checks validate that all API endpoints are properly configured
- The validation runs with strict error levels that treat warnings as failures
- The frontend configuration endpoint provides runtime settings to the frontend application
- This endpoint must remain publicly accessible and continue functioning as designed
- The endpoint's response format and behavior must not change

**Technical Reference** (for backend-developer):
The Django system check identifies: `drf_spectacular.W002` for the `frontend_config` view in `/app/apps/api/config_views.py`. The warning indicates the API documentation system cannot automatically infer the serializer for this function-based view. The startup script runs with `--fail-level WARNING`, treating this as a failure.

Possible approaches include:
1. Define an explicit serializer class for the configuration response structure
2. Use the `@extend_schema` decorator to document the endpoint's response format
3. Configure the view to be excluded from API schema generation if not needed in documentation
4. Ensure the solution maintains the endpoint's public accessibility and response format

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When the production container starts, the system validation completes successfully without API documentation warnings
- When I access the frontend configuration endpoint, it returns the same configuration data with the same structure as before the fix
- When I view the API documentation, the frontend configuration endpoint is either properly documented with correct response schema or intentionally excluded
- When the CI/CD pipeline runs the "Build Backend Production Container - Test container starts" job, the container startup validation passes

## Notes

### Story Quality Validation
- All stories are implementation-agnostic (no prescribed solutions)
- All stories focus on WHAT needs to work, not HOW to implement it
- All acceptance criteria describe user-observable or system-observable outcomes
- Stories work with any technology stack or implementation approach

### Root Cause
The API documentation generation system requires explicit schema configuration for function-based API views. The production container's startup validation enforces strict configuration requirements to catch potential issues before deployment.

### Fix Scope
This fix focuses solely on resolving the API documentation configuration issue. The endpoint's functionality, response format, and accessibility must remain unchanged. The solution should ensure the production container can start successfully while maintaining all existing behavior.
