# User Stories - Fix Issue #177: Backend Container Static Directory Configuration

**Issue**: Workflow Run #59 Failed: Backend CI/CD (0 failure(s))
**Feature**: 9 - Container Build and Validation in CI/CD Pipelines
**Branch**: feature/9-docker-cicd-validation
**Created**: 2025-10-24

## Problem Summary

The backend production container fails to start during CI/CD validation because the application requires a static files directory that doesn't exist in the container filesystem. This prevents successful deployment and blocks the CI/CD pipeline from completing.

## Business Impact

- Production container cannot start, preventing backend API deployment
- CI/CD pipeline is blocked, preventing any updates from reaching production
- Development velocity is halted until container configuration is corrected

## User Stories

### Story-177.1: Container Static Files Directory Configuration

**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** the production container to have all required directories created during the build process
**So that** the application can start successfully without runtime directory creation failures

**Description**:

When the backend application starts in a production container, it performs system checks to verify the environment is properly configured. One of these checks validates that all configured static file directories exist on the filesystem. Currently, the Django configuration references a `/app/static` directory in `STATICFILES_DIRS`, but this directory is not created during the container build process.

The production container must have all directories that the application expects to exist created during the build phase. This ensures that when the application starts, all filesystem dependencies are satisfied and deployment checks pass successfully.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Given the container build process runs, when it completes, then the `/app/static` directory should exist in the container filesystem
- Given the production container starts with deployment checks enabled, when Django runs system checks, then no warnings about missing static file directories should appear
- Given the container startup validation runs in CI/CD, when the container starts with deployment checks, then it should exit with code 0 (success)
- Given the container is deployed to a production environment, when the application initializes, then all required directories should be present and the application should start without directory-related errors

**Assigned To**: devops-engineer

**Priority**: Critical

**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 days

**Dependencies**: None

**Technical Context** (for implementation reference):

The error occurs during Django's deployment checks:
```
SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:
WARNINGS:
?: (staticfiles.W004) The directory '/app/static' in the STATICFILES_DIRS setting does not exist.
```

The container build succeeds, but startup validation fails when Django runs with `--fail-level WARNING`. The solution requires either:
1. Creating the `/app/static` directory in the Dockerfile (e.g., `RUN mkdir -p /app/static`)
2. Updating Django settings to remove the non-existent directory from `STATICFILES_DIRS`

The devops-engineer should determine the appropriate approach based on whether the static directory serves a purpose in production or is a vestigial configuration that can be removed.

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Container Configuration Fix (Sequential)
1. **Story-177.1** - Container Static Files Directory Configuration
   - **Agent**: devops-engineer
   - **Action**: Update container build configuration to ensure all required directories exist

## Success Criteria

- Backend production container builds successfully
- Container starts successfully with Django deployment checks enabled
- CI/CD pipeline "Test container starts" step passes with exit code 0
- No static file directory warnings appear in deployment checks
- Pipeline completes successfully and can deploy to production

## Verification Steps

After implementation, verify:
1. Container build completes without errors
2. Container startup validation passes in CI/CD
3. Django system checks report no warnings about missing directories
4. Backend CI/CD workflow completes successfully
5. Application can start in production-like environment

## Notes

- This is a single atomic fix focused on container filesystem configuration
- The issue affects only the backend production container
- The fix should ensure production containers have all expected filesystem dependencies
- Consider whether the static directory is actually needed in production or if it's legacy configuration
