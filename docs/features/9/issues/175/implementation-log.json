    "summary": "Fixed backend production container startup test by adding PostgreSQL and Redis service containers to the build-backend-prod-container job, enabling the container to complete its full initialization sequence successfully.",
    "approach": "Option A - Add PostgreSQL/Redis to Container Test",
    "rationale": "This approach ensures the container startup test mirrors the production environment as closely as possible, validating that the container can successfully complete its entrypoint script checks (configuration validation, database connectivity, deployment checks, migrations, and static file collection) before starting the application server.",
