# Fix User Stories: Issue #184 - Frontend CI/CD Security Scan Failures

**Feature ID**: 9
**Issue Number**: 184
**Issue Title**: Workflow Run #192 Failed: Frontend CI/CD (0 failure(s))
**Branch**: feature/9-docker-cicd-validation
**Created**: 2025-10-25

## Issue Context

The Frontend CI/CD pipeline failed during security scanning of the production container. The security scanner detected vulnerabilities in the production frontend Docker container that exceeded acceptable security thresholds (CRITICAL: 0, HIGH: 5). Additionally, the workflow lacks permissions to upload security scan results to GitHub's Security tab for visibility.

## User Stories

### Story-184.1: Security Scan Results Visibility
**Assigned to**: devops-engineer
**Story ID**: Story-184.1
**Depends on**: None
**Priority**: Medium

**As a** development team member
**I want** security scan results to be visible in the GitHub Security dashboard
**So that** I can easily review and track container vulnerabilities without manually checking workflow logs

**Description**:
The CI/CD pipeline security scanning workflow currently fails to upload scan results to GitHub's Security tab due to insufficient workflow permissions. While the security scan executes successfully and produces results locally, team members cannot view vulnerability reports in the centralized Security dashboard. This reduces visibility into security issues and makes it harder to track remediation efforts.

The workflow needs appropriate permissions to upload security scan results in SARIF format to GitHub's Code Scanning API endpoint.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the security scan completes, when the workflow attempts to upload results, then the upload should succeed without "Resource not accessible by integration" errors
- Given security scan results are uploaded, when I navigate to the GitHub Security tab, then I should see Trivy scan results for the production frontend container
- Given the workflow runs, when I check the workflow logs, then I should see successful SARIF upload confirmation messages
- Given permissions are configured, when the workflow runs on pull requests and main branch, then security results should be visible in both contexts

**Technical Context** (for developer reference):
- Error: "Resource not accessible by integration" when uploading SARIF to GitHub Security tab
- Workflow job: Security Scan Production Container - Upload Trivy results to GitHub Security tab
- Requires: GitHub Actions workflow permissions configuration for `security-events: write` and `contents: read`
- Action: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3

### Story-184.2: Production Container Security Hardening
**Assigned to**: devops-engineer
**Story ID**: Story-184.2
**Depends on**: None
**Priority**: Critical

**As a** security-conscious organization
**I want** production containers to contain no critical vulnerabilities and minimal high-severity vulnerabilities
**So that** deployed applications are protected against known security threats and comply with security policies

**Description**:
The production frontend container currently contains security vulnerabilities that exceed the organization's acceptable risk thresholds. Security scanning detected either CRITICAL vulnerabilities (zero tolerance policy) or more than 5 HIGH-severity vulnerabilities in the container's base image or installed packages.

The production container must be hardened by updating vulnerable packages, selecting more secure base images, or removing unnecessary dependencies to ensure only containers meeting security standards can be deployed to production.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the production container is built, when security scanning runs, then CRITICAL vulnerabilities should be 0
- Given the production container is built, when security scanning runs, then HIGH vulnerabilities should be 5 or fewer
- Given security thresholds are met, when the "Parse scan results and generate summary" step runs, then it should exit with code 0 (success)
- Given the security scan passes, when I review the scan summary, then I should see a clear report of vulnerability counts by severity level

**Technical Context** (for developer reference):
- Current failure: "Parse scan results and generate summary" step exits with code 1
- Scanned image: `frontend:prod-b908f13` (Alpine Linux 3.21 base)
- Total packages: 68 Alpine packages
- Thresholds: CRITICAL=0, HIGH=5
- Scanner: Trivy (via aquasecurity/trivy-action)
- Likely causes: Outdated Alpine base image, vulnerable Node.js packages, or nginx vulnerabilities
- Investigation needed: Review Trivy scan output to identify specific vulnerable packages
- Remediation approaches: Update Alpine base image version, update npm dependencies, remove unnecessary packages, or switch to distroless/minimal base images

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Parallel Investigation and Quick Wins
Execute these stories in parallel as they are independent:
- **Story-184.1**: Security Scan Results Visibility (devops-engineer)
- **Story-184.2**: Production Container Security Hardening (devops-engineer)

**Rationale**: Story-184.1 is a quick configuration fix that improves visibility, while Story-184.2 requires investigation and may take longer. Both can be worked on simultaneously.

- ✅ Stories work for ANY technology stack
- ✅ All stories are atomic (1-3 days max)
- ✅ Average acceptance criteria per story: 4

## Implementation Notes

**Story-184.1** addresses the non-blocking security dashboard visibility issue and should be a quick configuration change. This improves developer experience and security visibility.

**Story-184.2** is the critical blocking failure that prevents deployment. This requires investigation to identify vulnerable packages and remediation through base image updates, dependency updates, or container optimization.

Both stories are assigned to the devops-engineer as they involve CI/CD workflow configuration and container security, which fall under DevOps domain expertise.
