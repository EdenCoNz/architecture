# User Stories - Fix Issue #188: Backend Health Endpoint Returning Wrong Status Code

**Issue**: Workflow Run #65 Failed: Backend CI/CD (0 failure(s))
**Feature ID**: 9
**Branch**: feature/9-docker-cicd-validation
**Created**: 2025-10-25

## Overview

The backend production container's health endpoint is returning HTTP 301 (redirect/moved permanently) instead of HTTP 200 (success), preventing CI/CD pipeline validation from confirming the container is operational. While the container starts successfully and all supporting services are healthy, the health check endpoint configuration is causing unwanted redirects instead of direct responses.

## Business Context

For continuous deployment to function reliably, the CI/CD pipeline must verify that deployed containers are responding correctly to health checks. When health endpoints return redirects instead of success responses, automated deployment processes cannot confirm application readiness, blocking the deployment workflow and preventing new features from reaching users.

## User Stories

### Story-188.1: Health Endpoint Returns Success Status
**Assigned to**: backend-developer

**As a** deployment automation system
**I want** the health endpoint to return HTTP 200 status code directly
**So that** I can verify the backend container is operational and ready to serve requests

**Description**:
The health endpoint should respond with HTTP 200 (success) status code when accessed, without performing any redirects. The endpoint must confirm that the application is running and able to handle requests, providing the CI/CD pipeline with a reliable signal that the container is healthy and operational.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the backend container is running, when I send a GET request to the health endpoint, then I receive HTTP 200 status code
- Given I access the health endpoint, when the response is received, then the response time is under 100ms
- Given the health endpoint is called, when checking the response headers, then there are no redirect location headers present
- Given the CI/CD pipeline tests the health endpoint, when making 20 consecutive requests, then all 20 requests return HTTP 200 status code

**Technical Context** (for developer reference):
The current behavior shows HTTP 301 redirects, likely due to:
- URL routing configuration requiring or not requiring trailing slashes
- Middleware forcing redirects in production settings (HTTPS, trailing slash, etc.)
- Security settings affecting health endpoint routing

Test output shows consistent 301 responses with fast response times (12-14ms), indicating the server is running but routing configuration needs adjustment.

## Success Criteria

The fix is complete when:
1. Backend health endpoint returns HTTP 200 status code
2. No redirects occur when accessing the health endpoint
3. CI/CD pipeline health check test passes (20/20 successful requests)
4. Backend production container functional testing job succeeds
5. Backend CI/CD workflow completes without failures

---

## Notes

- The container itself is healthy - this is purely a routing/configuration issue
- Supporting services (PostgreSQL, Redis) are confirmed healthy
- Response times are fast, indicating the server is running normally
- The fix should preserve security configurations while allowing direct health check responses
