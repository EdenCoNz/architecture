# User Stories for Issue #176: Frontend CI/CD Security Scan Upload Failures

**Issue**: Workflow Run #188 Failed: Frontend CI/CD (0 failure(s))
**Feature ID**: 9
**Branch**: feature/9-docker-cicd-validation
**Created**: 2025-10-24

## Problem Summary

The frontend CI/CD pipeline is failing when attempting to upload container security scan results to GitHub's Security tab. Both the production and development container security scan jobs complete successfully, but the upload step fails with "Resource not accessible by integration" errors. This prevents the pipeline from completing and blocks viewing security scan results in GitHub's centralized Security dashboard.

## Root Cause

GitHub Actions workflows require specific repository-level permissions or security features to be enabled before they can upload code scanning results (SARIF files) to the Security tab. The workflow has the correct `security-events: write` permission configured, but the repository itself may not have the required security features enabled (GitHub Advanced Security or Code Scanning API access).

## User Stories

### Story-9-FIX-176.1: Enable Security Scanning Integration

**As a** development team member
**I want** the CI/CD pipeline to successfully upload security scan results to GitHub
**So that** we can view and manage container security vulnerabilities in GitHub's centralized Security dashboard without pipeline failures

**Priority**: HIGH
**Story Points**: 2
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the frontend CI/CD workflow runs security scans on development and production containers, **when** the Trivy scanner completes successfully, **then** the SARIF results should be uploaded to GitHub's Security tab without errors

2. **Given** the workflow attempts to upload SARIF files using `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`, **when** the upload step executes, **then** it should complete with exit code 0 and no "Resource not accessible by integration" errors

3. **Given** security scan results are uploaded successfully, **when** I navigate to the repository's Security tab in GitHub, **then** I should see the container vulnerability scan results displayed in the Code Scanning section

4. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline completes all container build and security scan jobs, **when** all steps succeed, **then** the entire workflow should pass without failures and show green status

#### Implementation Notes

**Technical Context** (for developer reference):
- Error occurs in `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3` action
- Error message: "Resource not accessible by integration - https://docs.github.com/rest/actions/workflow-runs#get-a-workflow-run"
- Workflow already has `security-events: write` permission configured
- Both security-scan-dev and security-scan-prod jobs affected
- Jobs: Security Scan Production Container (53557663412), Security Scan Development Container (53557745498)

**Potential Solutions**:
- Enable GitHub Advanced Security (if repository is private and feature not enabled)
- Enable Code Scanning in repository settings
- Configure repository security settings to allow SARIF uploads
- Alternative: If Advanced Security unavailable, implement fallback to store scan results as workflow artifacts instead of uploading to Security tab
- Verify organization-level security policies aren't blocking the integration

**Definition of Done**:
- Security scan jobs complete without failures
- SARIF uploads succeed or gracefully fallback to artifacts
- Pipeline passes with green status
- Security vulnerabilities are visible either in Security tab or as downloadable artifacts

## Story Dependencies

- **Story-9-FIX-176.1**: Independent story - can be implemented immediately

---

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Enable Security Integration (Sequential)
1. **Story-9-FIX-176.1** - Enable security scanning integration or implement artifact-based fallback

---

## Agent Assignment Summary

- **devops-engineer**: 1 story (Story-9-FIX-176.1)

---

## Success Metrics

- CI/CD pipeline passes without failures
- Security scan results are accessible (either via Security tab or artifacts)
- Zero "Resource not accessible by integration" errors
- Team can view container vulnerability scan results

---

## Notes

- This is a CI/CD configuration/permissions issue, not a code quality issue
- The security scans themselves are working correctly - only the upload step fails
- If GitHub Advanced Security is not available (private repos without feature), the fallback should gracefully store results as artifacts
- Priority is to unblock the pipeline while maintaining security visibility
