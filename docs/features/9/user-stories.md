**Key Deliverables**:
- Frontend container building in CI pipeline
- Backend container building in CI pipeline
- Container functional testing for both applications
- Security vulnerability scanning for all images
- Image size optimization validation
- Layer caching for faster builds
- Container registry integration
- Intelligent image tagging strategy
- Build status reporting and visibility
- Optional multi-architecture support

**Success Criteria**:
- Container images are built and validated on every code change
- Security vulnerabilities are detected before deployment
- Build artifacts (containers) match deployment artifacts
- Images are properly versioned and traceable
- Build times are optimized through caching
- Failed container builds block code from being merged
- Deployment artifacts are available in container registry

**Build-Test Gap Resolution**:
This feature closes the gap where CI validates source code but not deployment artifacts. After implementation, every code change will build, test, scan, and validate the actual containers that will be deployed, ensuring production artifacts match tested artifacts.
