## User Stories

### Story 8.1: Frontend Development Container

**Title**: Frontend Development Container
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a frontend developer, I want to run the frontend application in a containerized development environment, so that my local development setup matches other environments and I can start developing without installing dependencies directly on my machine.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have container runtime installed, when I start the frontend development container, then the application should start and be accessible in my browser
- Given I modify source code files, when I save changes, then the application should automatically reload with my changes visible
- Given the container is running, when I install new dependencies, then they should be available immediately without rebuilding
- Given I stop the container, when I restart it later, then my installed dependencies and development state should be preserved

**Dependencies**: None

**Notes**:
- Should support hot module replacement for fast development feedback
- Volume mounts should enable live code editing
- Container should expose appropriate ports for browser access

### Story 8.5: Frontend Environment Configuration Management

**Title**: Frontend Environment Configuration Management
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage frontend environment-specific settings and secrets from a single configuration location, so that I can easily configure the application for different environments (local, staging, production) without modifying code.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I need to configure the frontend for an environment, when I update the configuration file, then the application should use those settings without code changes
- Given I start the frontend container, when the application initializes, then it should load the correct configuration for that environment
- Given I need to change API endpoints, when I update the configuration, then the application should connect to the new endpoints
- Given sensitive values are needed, when I store them in the configuration, then they should be kept secure and not exposed in client-side code

**Dependencies**: 8.1, 8.2

**Notes**:
- Configuration should support multiple environments (local, staging, production)
- Sensitive values should be injected at build/runtime, not committed to version control
- Should provide clear documentation on which values can be configured
- Should validate required configuration is present before application starts

### Story 8.6: Backend Environment Configuration Management

**Title**: Backend Environment Configuration Management
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage backend environment-specific settings and secrets from a single configuration location, so that I can easily configure the application for different environments (local, staging, production) without modifying code.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I need to configure the backend for an environment, when I update the configuration file, then the application should use those settings without code changes
- Given I start the backend container, when the application initializes, then it should load the correct configuration for that environment
- Given I need to change database credentials, when I update the configuration, then the application should connect to the database successfully
- Given I review the configuration, when I check for sensitive values, then they should not be committed to version control

**Dependencies**: 8.3, 8.4

**Notes**:
- Configuration should support multiple environments (local, staging, production)
- Should handle database URLs, secret keys, API keys, third-party service credentials
- Should provide example configuration with placeholder values
- Should validate required configuration is present before application starts

### Story 8.7: Multi-Container Orchestration for Local Development

**Title**: Multi-Container Orchestration for Local Development
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
As a developer, I want to start all application containers (frontend, backend, database) with a single command, so that I can quickly set up my complete development environment without managing each service individually.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I run the orchestration command, when the process completes, then all services (frontend, backend, database) should be running and accessible
- Given all containers are running, when I access the frontend, then it should successfully communicate with the backend
- Given I stop the orchestration, when I run the stop command, then all containers should stop cleanly
- Given I need to rebuild containers, when I run the rebuild command, then containers should rebuild and restart with new changes

**Dependencies**: 8.1, 8.3

**Notes**:
- Should configure networking between containers automatically
- Should define service dependencies and startup order
- Should provide simple commands for common operations (start, stop, rebuild, logs)
- Should support running only specific services if needed

### Story 8.8: Container Health Monitoring

**Title**: Container Health Monitoring
**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: Medium

**Description**:
As a DevOps engineer, I want containers to report their health status, so that the container runtime can detect failures and restart unhealthy containers automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a container is running, when I check its health status, then it should report whether the application is functioning correctly
- Given the application becomes unresponsive, when the health check fails, then the container should be marked as unhealthy
- Given a container is unhealthy, when the container runtime detects this, then it should restart the container automatically
- Given I view container status, when I check the health information, then I should see clear health check results

**Dependencies**: 8.2, 8.4

**Notes**:
- Health checks should verify application is actually responding, not just running
- Should check critical dependencies (database connectivity for backend)
- Health check intervals should be appropriate for each service
- Should avoid false positives during application startup
