        "decision": "Implement differential caching strategy (1 year for assets, 1 hour for HTML)",
        "rationale": "Vite build includes content hash in asset filenames (index-GIsYOBfW.js), making them immutable and safe for long-term caching. HTML files need shorter cache to allow SPA route updates and index.html changes. This strategy maximizes cache hits while ensuring updates propagate quickly."
