# Feature 21 - Issue #363: CI/CD Code Formatting Violations

## Issue Context
**Issue**: #363 - CI/CD Pipeline Failed: Build and Test - Run #151
**Feature**: 21 - Sports Terminology and Database Storage
**Branch**: feature/21-sports-terminology-and-storage
**Type**: Code Quality / Formatting
**Impact**: CI/CD pipeline blocked, preventing deployment

## Root Cause Analysis
Feature 21 implementation was committed without running code formatting tools. The Black code formatter identified 15 Python files in the backend that don't meet project formatting standards, causing the CI/CD pipeline to fail during the linting and type checking stage.

This is a process failure rather than a functional issue - the code works correctly but doesn't meet the project's code quality standards. The formatter violations prevent the pipeline from progressing to deployment stages.

### Story 21-363.1: Apply Code Formatting to Backend Files

**ID**: Story-21-363.1
**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High

#### Description
As a development team, we need all Python code to meet project formatting standards so that the CI/CD pipeline can proceed through quality gates and enable deployment to staging and production environments.

Recent code changes in Feature 21 introduced formatting violations in 15 Python files. These violations block the CI/CD pipeline at the linting stage, preventing any progress toward deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** I run the Black code formatter on affected backend files
   **When** the formatter completes
   **Then** all 15 files should conform to Black formatting standards:
   - /app/apps/assessments/views.py
   - /app/apps/assessments/serializers.py
   - /app/tests/factories.py
   - /app/tests/examples/test_data_generator_examples.py
   - /app/tests/test_data_generators.py
   - /app/tests/test_data_isolation.py
   - /app/tests/test_story_21_1_verification.py
   - /app/tests/integration/test_migrate_equipment_data.py
   - /app/tests/test_story_21_2_migration.py
   - /app/tests/test_story_21_3_display_labels.py
   - /app/tests/integration/test_assessment_api.py
   - /app/tests/unit/test_assessment_database_constraints.py
   - /app/tests/unit/test_assessment_models.py
   - /app/tests/test_story_21_6_api_contract.py
   - /app/tests/unit/test_assessment_serializers.py

2. **Given** all files have been formatted
   **When** I run the Black formatter in check mode (as the CI/CD pipeline does)
   **Then** the formatter should report "0 files would be reformatted" and exit with code 0

3. **Given** the formatting has been applied
   **When** the CI/CD pipeline runs the linting and type checking stage
   **Then** the Black code formatter check should pass successfully

#### Technical Notes
- Run Black formatter: `black /app/apps/assessments/views.py /app/apps/assessments/serializers.py /app/tests/factories.py /app/tests/examples/test_data_generator_examples.py /app/tests/test_data_generators.py /app/tests/test_data_isolation.py /app/tests/test_story_21_1_verification.py /app/tests/integration/test_migrate_equipment_data.py /app/tests/test_story_21_2_migration.py /app/tests/test_story_21_3_display_labels.py /app/tests/integration/test_assessment_api.py /app/tests/unit/test_assessment_database_constraints.py /app/tests/unit/test_assessment_models.py /app/tests/test_story_21_6_api_contract.py /app/tests/unit/test_assessment_serializers.py`
- Verify with check mode: `black --check /app/apps/assessments/ /app/tests/`
- This is a non-functional change - code behavior should remain identical
- All existing tests must continue to pass after formatting

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] All 15 files pass Black formatting checks
- [ ] Black formatter check mode reports 0 files would be reformatted
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] CI/CD linting stage passes
- [ ] Changes committed with message: "Fix issue #363: Code formatting violations"

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Format Code (Sequential)
1. Story-21-363.1 (backend-developer) - Apply code formatting

## Summary

**Total Stories**: 1
**Assigned Agents**:
- backend-developer (1 story)

**Execution Phases**: 1
**Estimated Effort**: <1 hour

**Issue Resolution Path**:
This is a straightforward formatting fix with a single atomic story. Running the Black formatter on the affected files will resolve all violations and unblock the CI/CD pipeline. The formatter will automatically apply consistent formatting without changing code behavior.

**Prevention**:
The root cause is that code was committed without running formatters. Future commits should include pre-commit hook verification or developer workflow updates to ensure formatting tools run before committing code.
