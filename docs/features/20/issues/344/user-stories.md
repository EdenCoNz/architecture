## Issue Summary
**Feature**: #20 - Basic Login Functionality
**Branch**: feature/20-basic-login
**Total Failures**: 33 linting errors + 1 warning
**Root Cause**: Code formatting and quality violations introduced during Feature #20 implementation

### Error Categories
1. **Code Formatting (Prettier)**: 18 errors across 4 files (AssessmentFormStepper.tsx, LoginForm.tsx, Login.test.tsx, Login.tsx)
2. **Import Organization (ESLint)**: 2 duplicate import errors (LoginForm.tsx)

## User Stories

### Story 344.1: Fix Code Formatting Violations
**ID**: Story-344.1
**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None

**Description**:
As a development team, we need all frontend code to comply with the project's code formatting standards so that the CI/CD pipeline can successfully build and deploy our application.

**Context**:
During Feature #20 implementation, code was committed without running the automatic formatter. Prettier has detected 18 formatting violations across 4 files that prevent the build from passing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given I run the linting command, when Prettier checks AssessmentFormStepper.tsx, then it should report zero formatting errors
2. Given I run the linting command, when Prettier checks LoginForm.tsx, then it should report zero formatting errors (2 errors currently)
3. Given I run the linting command, when Prettier checks Login.test.tsx, then it should report zero formatting errors (10 errors currently)
4. Given I run the linting command, when Prettier checks Login.tsx, then it should report zero formatting errors (5 errors currently)
5. Given I run the full CI/CD pipeline, when the Build and Test job executes, then Prettier validation should pass with zero errors

**Technical Notes**:
- Affected files:
  - `frontend/src/components/AssessmentFormStepper.tsx`: 1 error
  - `frontend/src/components/LoginForm.tsx`: 2 errors
  - `frontend/src/pages/Login.test.tsx`: 10 errors
  - `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`: 5 errors
- Solution: Run automatic formatter (npm run format or equivalent)
- Verify: npm run lint should pass

### Story 344.2: Fix Duplicate Import Statements
**ID**: Story-344.2
**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None

**Description**:
As a developer, I need all import statements to be unique and organized so that the code is maintainable and the CI/CD quality checks pass.

**Context**:
The LoginForm component has duplicate import statements for `react` and `../../types` modules. ESLint's no-duplicate-imports rule is flagging these as errors, preventing the build from passing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given I review LoginForm.tsx imports, when I check for react imports, then there should be only one import statement for react
2. Given I review LoginForm.tsx imports, when I check for types imports, then there should be only one import statement for ../../types
3. Given I run the linting command, when ESLint checks LoginForm.tsx, then it should report zero no-duplicate-imports errors
4. Given I run the full CI/CD pipeline, when the Build and Test job executes, then ESLint validation should pass with zero import duplication errors

**Technical Notes**:
- Affected file: `frontend/src/components/LoginForm.tsx`
- Violations: 2 duplicate import errors
- ESLint Rule: no-duplicate-imports
- Solution: Consolidate duplicate imports into single statements

### Story 344.3: Remove Development Debug Statements
**ID**: Story-344.3
**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: None

**Description**:
As a development team, we need production code to be free of debug logging statements so that our logs remain clean and meaningful in production environments.

**Context**:
A console.log statement was left in the Login.tsx component during development. While this doesn't block the build (it's a warning), it adds unnecessary noise to production logs and violates code quality standards.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given I review Login.tsx code, when I search for console statements, then there should be no console.log, console.warn, or console.error statements
2. Given I run the linting command, when ESLint checks Login.tsx, then it should report zero no-console warnings
3. Given I run the full CI/CD pipeline, when the Build and Test job executes, then ESLint validation should complete with zero console statement warnings

**Technical Notes**:
- Affected file: `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`
- Violation: 1 console.log warning
- ESLint Rule: no-console
- Solution: Remove or replace with proper logging mechanism
- Note: This is a warning, not an error, but should still be addressed for code quality

The issue is considered resolved when:
1. All 18 Prettier formatting errors are resolved
2. All 2 duplicate import errors are resolved
3. The 1 console.log warning is resolved
4. CI/CD pipeline Build and Test job passes successfully
5. No new linting errors or warnings are introduced
