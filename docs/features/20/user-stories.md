## User Stories

### Story 20.1: Define API contract for login
**Agent**: api-contract-designer
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Description**
As a development team, we need a clear API contract for the basic login functionality so that frontend and backend teams can work in parallel and ensure consistent data exchange for user authentication.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Given the need for login functionality, when reviewing the contract, then all authentication endpoints are specified
- Given the contract is defined, when examining request formats, then the name and email field requirements are clear
- Given the contract is defined, when examining response formats, then success and error responses are documented
- Given the contract enables parallel development, when teams review it, then both frontend and backend can implement independently

### Story 20.6: Process login request
**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story 20.1 (API contract)
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

**Description**
As a system, I need to receive and process login requests containing user name and email so that I can authenticate users and provide them access to the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Given a login request is received, when it contains valid name and email, then the system should accept the request
- Given a login request is received, when required fields are missing, then the system should reject the request with a clear error message
- Given a login request is received, when the email format is invalid, then the system should reject the request with a validation error
- Given a valid login is processed, when authentication succeeds, then the system should return a success response with user information

### Story 20.7: Store user information
**Agent**: backend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story 20.1 (API contract), Story 20.6
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Description**
As a system, I need to store user login information so that I can identify returning users and maintain their preferences across sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Given a new user logs in, when their information is submitted, then their name and email should be stored
- Given an existing user logs in, when their email matches a stored record, then their existing information should be retrieved
- Given a user logs in, when their name has changed, then the stored information should be updated
- Given user information is stored, when queried by email, then the system should return the user's details

### Phase 3: Frontend Collection (Parallel after Phase 1 & Phase 2)
Frontend form fields can be implemented in parallel once design and contract are ready:
- **Story 20.3**: Collect user name (frontend-developer)
- **Story 20.4**: Collect user email address (frontend-developer)

### Phase 4: Data Persistence (Parallel after Phase 2)
These backend stories can be developed in parallel:
- **Story 20.7**: Store user information (backend-developer)
- **Story 20.8**: Maintain login session (backend-developer)

### Phase 5: Integration (Sequential after Phase 3 & Phase 2)
