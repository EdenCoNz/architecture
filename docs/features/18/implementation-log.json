      {
        "decision": "Defined line count reduction as primary metric with 50-65% target",
        "rationale": "AC1 requires defining how to measure verbosity - line count is objective, measurable, and directly reflects the feature goal"

        "decision": "Added entry density (lines per story entry) as secondary metric with 30-50% reduction target",
        "rationale": "Provides additional dimension to measure conciseness - complements total line count by measuring individual entry verbosity"

        "decision": "Created two checklists: Essential Information Checklist and Inappropriate Content Checklist",
        "rationale": "AC2 and AC3 require identifying what should be present and absent - separate checklists make validation systematic and comprehensive"
      },
      {
        "decision": "Included side-by-side comparison of pre-update vs post-update log structures with examples",

        "rationale": "If validation fails, plan provides specific guidance on how to fix the issues rather than just identifying problems"

      {
        "decision": "Added validation report template and ongoing monitoring schedule",

      "Documented pre-update log characteristics with example JSON structure (10-20+ actions, process-oriented, 200-400 lines/story)",
      "Documented post-update log characteristics with example JSON structure (3-7 entries, outcome-oriented, 70-140 lines/story)",
