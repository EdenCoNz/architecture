# Feature #3: Initialize Backend Project

## Overview
Initialize a modern backend application in the backend/ directory with proper project structure, build tooling, testing infrastructure, and foundational components. This backend will serve as the API layer for the React frontend application.

## User Stories

### 1. Initialize Backend Project with Build Tooling
Initialize the backend project in the backend/ directory with a modern Node.js/TypeScript setup including package manager, build configuration, and TypeScript compiler settings.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/package.json created with project metadata and scripts (dev, build, start, test)
- TypeScript configured with tsconfig.json (strict mode, ES2022 target, path aliases)
- Build tooling configured (tsx for development, tsc for production builds)
- Git ignore file created for backend-specific patterns

### 2. Create Project Directory Structure
Establish a scalable directory structure in the backend/ folder following best practices for API development with clear separation of concerns.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Directory structure created: src/controllers/, src/services/, src/models/, src/middleware/, src/routes/, src/utils/, src/config/, src/types/
- Additional directories: tests/unit/, tests/integration/, tests/fixtures/
- Index.ts entry point created in src/ with placeholder exports
- README.md stub created explaining directory structure

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: none

### 3. Set Up Express Application Foundation
Create the core Express.js application setup with essential middleware for JSON parsing, CORS, security headers, and request logging.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Express app initialized in src/app.ts with middleware (JSON parser, CORS, helmet, morgan)
- Health check endpoint GET /health returns 200 with status object
- Error handling middleware configured for 404 and general errors
- CORS configured to allow frontend origin (http://localhost:5173 for development)

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #1, #2

---

### 4. Configure Development Environment
Set up development environment tooling including ESLint, Prettier, environment variable management, and hot reload for optimal developer experience.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ESLint configured for TypeScript with Node.js-specific rules
- Prettier configured for consistent code formatting (matching frontend standards)
- .env.example created with documented environment variables (PORT, NODE_ENV, LOG_LEVEL)
- Development script configured with hot reload using tsx watch mode

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #3

---

### 5. Create Server Entry Point
Create the server entry point that starts the Express application, handles graceful shutdown, and includes proper error handling for startup failures.

Acceptance Criteria:
- src/server.ts created to start Express server on configurable port
- Environment variables loaded from .env file (using dotenv)
- Graceful shutdown handlers implemented for SIGTERM and SIGINT
- Server startup logs include port and environment information

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #4

---

### 6. Set Up Testing Infrastructure with Vitest
Configure Vitest as the testing framework with TypeScript support, test utilities, and initial test setup for unit and integration tests.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Vitest configured in vitest.config.ts with Node environment
- Test scripts added to package.json (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
- Test setup file created with global test utilities
- Minimum 80% coverage threshold configured

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #5

---

### 7. Write Health Check Endpoint Tests
Write comprehensive tests for the health check endpoint demonstrating TDD approach and establishing testing patterns for the project.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Test file created at tests/integration/health.test.ts
- Tests verify GET /health returns 200 status code
- Tests verify response body contains expected health status fields
- Tests use supertest for HTTP assertions

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #5

---

### 8. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Backend
Create GitHub Actions workflow for backend with automated testing, linting, and build verification on pull requests and main branch pushes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml created with Node.js 22 LTS
- Workflow includes jobs: install dependencies, run lint, run tests, build project
- Workflow runs on PRs to main and pushes to main
- Dependency caching configured for faster builds

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #5

---

### 9. Create Backend Documentation
Write comprehensive README.md in backend/ directory covering installation, available scripts, architecture, coding standards, and testing approach.

Acceptance Criteria:
- README.md includes: project overview, installation steps, available npm scripts
- Documentation covers: directory structure, coding conventions, environment variables
- Testing section explains how to run tests and maintain coverage
- Development workflow section explains hot reload and debugging

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #5, #6, #7

---

### 10. Configure Dockerization Foundation
Create Dockerfile and .dockerignore for the backend application with multi-stage builds for development and production environments.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dockerfile created with multi-stage build (development and production stages)
- .dockerignore configured to exclude node_modules, tests, .env files
- Development stage includes hot reload support
- Production stage creates optimized build with minimal image size

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #8
