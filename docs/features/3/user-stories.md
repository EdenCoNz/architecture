### 1. Initialize Backend Project with Build Tooling
Create the backend project directory structure with a modern Node.js/TypeScript foundation. Initialize package.json with essential metadata and scripts. Set up TypeScript compiler configuration with strict type checking. Create basic project entry point.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/ directory created with package.json containing project metadata and build scripts
- TypeScript configured with tsconfig.json using strict mode and ES module support
- Basic src/index.ts entry point file created that can be compiled and run
- Build command successfully compiles TypeScript to JavaScript output

### 2. Create Backend Project Directory Structure
Establish a scalable directory structure following backend best practices. Organize code by feature/domain with clear separation of concerns. Create directories for routes, controllers, services, models, middleware, utils, and types.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Directory structure created with folders: src/routes, src/controllers, src/services, src/models, src/middleware, src/utils, src/types, src/config
- Each directory contains an index.ts barrel export file for clean imports
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md documentation created explaining the purpose of each directory
- Directory structure supports feature-based organization and follows separation of concerns

### 3. Set Up Express Server Framework
Initialize Express.js server with TypeScript support. Configure basic middleware (CORS, JSON parsing, request logging). Create application entry point with server startup logic. Implement graceful shutdown handling.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Express.js installed and configured with TypeScript type definitions
- Server starts successfully on a configurable port (default 3001) with startup logging
- Basic middleware configured: CORS (allowing frontend origin), express.json(), request logging
- Graceful shutdown handler implemented for SIGTERM and SIGINT signals

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #1, #2

### 4. Configure Development Environment
Set up code quality tools and development workflow. Configure ESLint for TypeScript with Node.js specific rules. Set up Prettier for consistent formatting. Add nodemon for hot reload during development. Create development scripts in package.json.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ESLint configured with TypeScript parser and Node.js recommended rules
- Prettier configured with consistent formatting rules (matching frontend where applicable)
- nodemon configured to watch .ts files and auto-restart server on changes
- Development script (npm run dev) starts server with hot reload working

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #3

---

### 5. Implement Health Check Endpoint
Create a basic health check endpoint to verify server is running. Implement route handler following REST conventions. Add basic API versioning structure. Return server status and timestamp information.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GET /api/v1/health endpoint created and returns 200 status code
- Response includes JSON with status, timestamp, and service name fields
- Endpoint accessible when server is running and returns valid JSON
- Route follows REST conventions and API versioning pattern (/api/v1/*)

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #3

---

### 6. Create API Response Utilities
Develop standardized response utilities for consistent API responses. Create success and error response formatters. Implement HTTP status code constants. Add request/response type definitions for TypeScript.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Utility functions created for standardized success and error responses with consistent structure
- HTTP status codes defined as constants (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
- TypeScript interfaces defined for API response formats (success and error)
- Health check endpoint refactored to use new response utilities

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #4, #5

---

### 7. Set Up Testing Infrastructure
Configure testing framework for backend with TypeScript support. Set up Jest or Vitest with appropriate configuration. Create test utilities and setup files. Write tests for health check endpoint and response utilities.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Testing framework installed and configured with TypeScript support
- Test setup file created with necessary configuration and test utilities
- Tests written for health check endpoint verifying response format and status codes
- Test command (npm test) executes all tests successfully with coverage reporting

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #6

---

### 8. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Backend
Create GitHub Actions workflow for backend continuous integration. Configure automated testing, linting, and build verification. Set up workflow to run on pull requests and main branch pushes. Include security checks and dependency auditing.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GitHub Actions workflow file created (.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml)
- Workflow runs on pull requests to main and pushes to main branch
- Pipeline includes jobs for: install dependencies, lint check, format check, build verification, test execution
- Workflow uses Node.js LTS version and includes dependency caching for performance

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #6

---

### 9. Create Backend Documentation
Write comprehensive README.md for backend project. Document installation steps, available scripts, project structure, coding conventions, testing approach, and deployment considerations. Include API documentation structure.

Acceptance Criteria:
- README.md created in backend/ directory with comprehensive documentation
- Documentation includes: installation steps, available npm scripts, directory structure explanation, coding conventions
- Testing approach documented including how to run tests and TDD workflow
- API documentation section created with health check endpoint documented as example
