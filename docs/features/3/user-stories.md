# Feature #3: Automated Git Workflow for Feature Command

## Overview
Automatically commit all changes, push to remote, and create a pull request after the /feature command completes all user story implementations. This enhancement streamlines the development workflow by eliminating manual git operations.

## Missing Agents
None - All required functionality can be handled by existing agents (devops-engineer for git automation, backend-developer for command enhancement).

---

## User Stories

### 1. Detect Feature Implementation Completion
Add detection logic to the /feature command to determine when all user stories have been successfully implemented.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The /feature command monitors the /implement subprocess completion
- Implementation completion is verified by checking implementation-log.json for all stories marked as completed
- The feature ID is retained throughout the workflow for subsequent git operations

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: none

---

### 2. Stage All Feature Changes
Automatically stage all files modified during feature implementation after all user stories are completed.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All modified files in the working directory are staged using git add
- The command verifies files were successfully staged using git status
- Untracked files generated during implementation are included in staging

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #1

---

### 3. Create Feature Commit
Automatically create a git commit with a standardized message format after staging changes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Commit message follows format: "Feature {feature_id}: {feature_title}"
- Commit includes all staged changes from the feature implementation
- Commit creation is verified and commit hash is captured for reporting

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #2

---

### 4. Push to Remote Branch
Automatically push the feature branch to the remote repository after creating the commit.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The current branch is pushed to remote using git push
- If branch doesn't exist on remote, it's created with -u flag
- Push success is verified and any errors are caught and reported

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #3

---

### 5. Create Pull Request
Automatically create a pull request on GitHub after successfully pushing the feature branch.

Acceptance Criteria:
- PR is created using gh CLI with title "Feature {feature_id}: {feature_title}"
- PR body includes summary of user stories implemented (extracted from user-stories.md)
- PR URL is captured and included in the final report

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #4

---

### 6. Add Git Workflow Report
Enhance the /feature command final report to include git workflow status and PR link.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Report includes commit hash, branch name, and PR URL
- Any git operation failures are clearly reported with error details
- Success message confirms all steps completed: stories implemented, committed, pushed, PR created

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #5

---

### 7. Handle Git Workflow Failures
Add error handling to gracefully manage git operation failures without breaking the feature workflow.

Acceptance Criteria:
- If git operations fail, user stories remain marked as completed in implementation log
- Clear error messages guide user on manual git operations needed
- Partial success scenarios are handled (e.g., commit succeeded but push failed)

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #2, Story #3, Story #4, Story #5

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: backend-developer) - Detect implementation completion

### Phase 2 (Sequential)
- Story #2 (agent: devops-engineer) - Stage changes (depends on Story #1)

### Phase 3 (Sequential)
- Story #3 (agent: devops-engineer) - Create commit (depends on Story #2)

### Phase 4 (Sequential)
- Story #4 (agent: devops-engineer) - Push to remote (depends on Story #3)

### Phase 5 (Sequential)
- Story #5 (agent: devops-engineer) - Create PR (depends on Story #4)

### Phase 6 (Parallel)
- Story #6 (agent: backend-developer) - Add reporting (depends on Story #5)
- Story #7 (agent: backend-developer) - Handle errors (depends on Stories #2, #3, #4, #5)

---

## Story Refinement Summary
- Initial stories created: 7
- Stories after atomicity refinement: 7
- Stories split: 0
- Average acceptance criteria per story: 3
- All stories are atomic and independently deployable

---

## Technical Notes

### Git Operations Flow
1. Monitor /implement command completion
2. Verify all stories completed via implementation-log.json
3. Stage all changes: `git add .`
4. Commit: `git commit -m "Feature {id}: {title}"`
5. Push: `git push -u origin {branch}`
6. Create PR: `gh pr create --title "Feature {id}: {title}" --body "{summary}"`

### Files to Modify
- `.claude/commands/feature.md` - Add Step 3 for git workflow automation
- Implementation will leverage existing bash/git tools available to agents

### Error Scenarios
- No changes to commit (working directory clean)
- Push fails (network issues, permissions)
- PR creation fails (gh CLI not configured, repo access)
- Merge conflicts on remote branch
