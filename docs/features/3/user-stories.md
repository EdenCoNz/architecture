# Feature 3: Initialize Backend Project

Initialize a modern backend application in the backend/ directory with proper project structure, build tooling, testing infrastructure, and foundational components.

---

## User Stories

### 1. Research and Select Backend Technology Stack
Evaluate and select the backend technology stack including framework, runtime, database, ORM, API architecture, testing framework, and authentication approach. Document the analysis with comparison of options and rationale for selections aligned with the frontend stack (React, TypeScript, Material UI).

Acceptance Criteria:
- Technology stack comparison document created comparing at least 3 backend frameworks (Node.js/Express, Node.js/NestJS, Python/FastAPI, Go, etc.)
- Final technology selections documented with clear rationale for framework, database, ORM/ODM, API architecture (REST/GraphQL), testing framework, and auth strategy
- Selections consider frontend stack compatibility, TypeScript support, ecosystem maturity, and team expertise

### 2. Initialize Backend Project with Build Tooling
Create the backend/ directory and initialize the selected backend project with package manager, configuration files, and build tooling setup.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/ directory created with project initialized using selected framework
- package.json (or equivalent) configured with project metadata, dependencies, and scripts
- Build tooling configured (TypeScript compiler if using TypeScript, bundler if needed)
- Project successfully builds and runs with a basic "Hello World" endpoint

### 3. Create Backend Project Directory Structure
Establish a scalable directory structure for the backend project following industry best practices and framework conventions, including separation of routes, controllers, services, models, middleware, utils, and tests.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Directory structure created with clear separation of concerns (routes, controllers, services, models/entities, middleware, utils, config, tests)
- Structure documented in backend/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md explaining purpose of each directory
- README section added explaining the architectural pattern (MVC, layered architecture, clean architecture, etc.)

Dependencies: Story 2

### 4. Configure Development Environment
Set up development environment tools including linting, formatting, environment variable management, hot reload, and debugging configuration.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Linting configured (ESLint for Node.js or equivalent for other languages) with backend-appropriate rules
- Code formatting configured (Prettier or equivalent) with consistent style rules
- Environment variable management configured (.env support with validation)
- Hot reload/watch mode configured for development
- Development and production environment configurations separated

Dependencies: Story 3

### 5. Set Up Database Connection and Configuration
Configure database connection, connection pooling, and database client setup with proper error handling and environment-based configuration.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Database connection module created with connection pooling
- Environment-based configuration (development, test, production database URLs)
- Connection health check endpoint implemented
- Database connection error handling implemented with retry logic
- Database connection successfully tested in development environment

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story 1, Story 3

---

### 6. Implement Database Schema Management
Set up database migration tooling and create initial schema structure for managing database changes over time.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Migration tool configured (e.g., Knex, TypeORM migrations, Prisma migrate, Alembic, etc.)
- Initial migration created for base schema structure
- Migration scripts added to package.json (migrate up, down, reset)
- Migration successfully runs and creates expected schema in database

Dependencies: Story 5

### 7. Create Health Check and Basic API Endpoints
Implement foundational API endpoints including health check, version endpoint, and basic error handling middleware.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GET /health endpoint returns 200 with service status and database connectivity
- GET /api/version endpoint returns API version and environment information
- Global error handling middleware catches and formats errors consistently
- 404 handler for undefined routes returns proper JSON error response

Dependencies: Story 2, Story 5

### 8. Set Up Testing Infrastructure
Configure testing framework, test database, test utilities, and initial test examples demonstrating unit and integration testing patterns.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Testing framework configured (Jest, Vitest, pytest, Go testing, etc.) with backend-specific configuration
- Test database setup configured (separate from development database)
- Test utilities created for common testing patterns (test data factories, database cleanup, API request helpers)
- Example tests written for health check endpoint demonstrating integration testing
- Test coverage reporting configured

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story 7

### 9. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Backend
Create GitHub Actions workflow for backend CI/CD including linting, testing, build verification, and security scanning.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GitHub Actions workflow file created (.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml)
- Workflow runs on pull requests and main branch pushes for backend changes
- Workflow includes jobs for: lint, test (with test database), build verification, and dependency security scanning
- Workflow uses appropriate caching for dependencies
- Workflow configured with minimal permissions following security best practices

### 10. Create Backend Documentation
Write comprehensive README.md for the backend project covering installation, configuration, development workflow, API documentation, testing, and deployment.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/README.md created with installation instructions, prerequisites, and setup steps
- Environment variables documented with example .env.example file
- API endpoints documented with request/response examples
- Development workflow documented (running locally, running tests, database migrations)
- Project structure and architecture explained
- Testing guidelines and examples provided
