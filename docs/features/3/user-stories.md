### 1. Research and Select Backend Technology Stack
Research and evaluate backend frameworks, databases, and tools suitable for a production web application API. Consider Python (Django/FastAPI), Node.js (Express/NestJS), or other modern frameworks. Recommend stack based on performance, scalability, ecosystem maturity, testing capabilities, and alignment with project requirements.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Technology stack analysis document created comparing at least 3 framework options
- Recommendations include: backend framework, database, ORM/query builder, authentication library, API documentation tool
- Decision rationale documented with pros/cons for each option

Agent: research-specialist
Dependencies: none

### 2. Create Backend Project Directory Structure
Create the backend/ directory with a scalable, maintainable project structure following industry best practices for the chosen framework. Establish clear separation between configuration, application code, tests, and documentation.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/ directory created with subdirectories for config, src/app, tests, migrations, docs
- Directory structure follows framework conventions and best practices
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md created documenting the directory organization

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: none

---

### 3. Initialize Backend Project with Framework
Initialize the backend project with the selected framework, dependency management, and core configuration files. Set up project metadata, dependency specifications, and framework-specific configuration.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Backend framework initialized with dependency management (requirements.txt/package.json/etc.)
- Core configuration files created (settings, environment variables template)
- Project can start successfully with minimal configuration

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #1, #2

---

### 4. Configure Database Connection
Set up database configuration and connection management for the selected database system. Configure connection pooling, timeout settings, and environment-based configuration for development, testing, and production environments.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Database configuration implemented with connection pooling
- Environment variables configured for database credentials (.env.example created)
- Database connection can be established successfully

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #3

---

### 5. Create Core Application Structure
Build the core application structure including main application entry point, middleware configuration, request/response handling, error handling, and logging infrastructure.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Main application entry point created with framework initialization
- Middleware configured for CORS, request logging, error handling
- Health check endpoint implemented (GET /health) returning status 200

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #4

---

### 6. Implement Database Models and Migrations
Set up database migration system and create initial database schema. Implement ORM models for core entities and configure migration management for schema version control.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Database migration system configured and initialized
- Initial migration created for core schema
- Migrations can run successfully (up and down)

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #4

---

### 7. Configure Development Environment
Configure development environment tooling including code formatting, linting, type checking (if applicable), and hot-reload for efficient development workflow.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Code formatter configured (Black/Prettier/etc.) with project-specific rules
- Linter configured (pylint/ESLint/etc.) with comprehensive ruleset
- Hot-reload/auto-restart configured for development server

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #5, #6

---

### 8. Set Up Testing Infrastructure
Configure testing framework and infrastructure for unit tests, integration tests, and API endpoint tests. Set up test database configuration, test fixtures, and test running scripts.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Testing framework configured (pytest/Jest/etc.) with coverage reporting
- Test database configuration created (separate from development DB)
- Sample tests written for health check endpoint demonstrating testing patterns

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #7

---

### 9. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Backend
Create GitHub Actions workflow for backend continuous integration including dependency installation, linting, type checking, tests, and security scanning on pull requests and main branch.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GitHub Actions workflow created (.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml)
- Workflow includes: dependency install, lint, format check, tests with coverage
- Workflow runs successfully on push and pull request events

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #7

---

### 10. Create Backend Documentation
Write comprehensive backend documentation covering installation, configuration, development workflow, API endpoints, database schema, testing practices, and deployment guidelines.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/README.md created with installation, configuration, and development instructions
- API documentation approach documented (Swagger/OpenAPI/etc.)
- Database schema documentation included or referenced

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #8, #9
