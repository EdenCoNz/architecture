# Feature #3: Initialize Backend Project

## Feature Description
Initialize a complete backend project under the backend/ folder with modern development infrastructure including build tooling, project structure, code quality tools, testing framework, and CI/CD pipeline. This establishes the foundation for building server-side APIs and business logic.

## User Stories

### 1. Initialize Backend Project with Build Configuration
Initialize a new backend project in the backend/ directory with modern build tooling and package management. The project should support server-side development with proper compilation, transpilation, and module resolution configured.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Backend project exists in backend/ folder with package configuration file
- Build system configured to compile and bundle server code
- Development and production build scripts work successfully
- Project includes proper module resolution and path alias support

**Important**: This story describes WHAT needs to be achieved using generic, technology-agnostic language. ALL implementation details (technology choices, frameworks, libraries, tools, file formats, patterns, architecture) MUST be decided by the assigned development agent based on project context and best practices. DO NOT include ANY specific technology references in this story.

---

### 2. Create Backend Project Directory Structure
Establish a scalable, maintainable directory structure for the backend project that separates concerns and supports feature-based organization. The structure should accommodate routes/endpoints, business logic, data access, middleware, utilities, configuration, and tests.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Directory structure created with clear separation of concerns (routing, business logic, data access, middleware, utilities, configuration)
- Feature-based organization supports scalable growth
- Test directories mirror source structure
- Structure documented in project documentation file

---

### 3. Configure Development Environment
Set up development environment with code quality tools, linting, formatting, and hot reload capabilities. Developers should have consistent code style, automatic error detection, and fast feedback during development.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Code linting configured with comprehensive ruleset for code quality
- Code formatting configured with consistent style rules
- Editor configuration file ensures consistent settings across team
- Hot reload configured for automatic server restart on file changes

### 4. Create Basic Server Application
Build a minimal working server application with proper configuration, error handling, and request logging. The server should respond to health check requests and provide a foundation for adding routes and middleware.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Server starts successfully and listens on configurable port
- Health check endpoint returns successful response with server status
- Request logging middleware logs incoming requests
- Global error handling middleware catches and formats errors consistently

---

### 5. Set Up Testing Infrastructure
Configure testing framework for the backend project with unit and integration test capabilities. Developers should be able to run tests quickly with clear output, code coverage reporting, and watch mode for TDD workflow.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Testing framework configured with test runner and assertion library
- Example unit tests written for core server functionality
- Test coverage reporting configured and displays coverage metrics
- Watch mode works for running tests during development

---

### 6. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Backend
Create automated continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline that runs on pull requests and main branch. The pipeline should verify code quality, run tests, and ensure build succeeds before allowing merges.

Acceptance Criteria:
- CI/CD workflow file created with build, lint, and test jobs
- Pipeline runs automatically on pull requests and main branch pushes
- All checks must pass before pull request can be merged
- Workflow uses dependency caching for faster execution

---

### 7. Create Backend Documentation
Write comprehensive documentation covering installation, development workflow, project structure, coding conventions, testing approach, and deployment. Documentation should enable new developers to quickly understand and contribute to the backend project.

Acceptance Criteria:
- README file created with installation instructions, available scripts, and getting started guide
- Project structure documented with explanation of directory organization
- Coding conventions documented including naming conventions and best practices
- Testing approach documented with examples of writing and running tests

## Notes
- All stories focus on WHAT needs to be achieved, not HOW to implement
- Backend developer agent will choose appropriate technologies based on modern best practices and existing frontend context
- DevOps engineer will configure CI/CD using project's existing workflow patterns
- Documentation should mirror the comprehensive approach used in frontend project (Feature #1)
- Testing infrastructure should support TDD workflow from the start
- Backend developer should consider alignment with frontend tech stack where beneficial
