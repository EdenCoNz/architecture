# Feature 3: Initialize Backend Project

## Overview
Initialize a Node.js backend project under the backend/ directory with modern development infrastructure including TypeScript, Express framework, testing setup, code quality tools, project structure, and CI/CD pipeline. This establishes the foundation for building RESTful APIs and backend services.

## User Stories

### 1. Initialize Backend Project with Build Tooling
Initialize a Node.js project in the backend/ directory with TypeScript, npm package manager, and modern build tooling configured.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/ directory created with package.json configured for Node.js 20+ and npm
- TypeScript installed and tsconfig.json configured with strict mode and modern ES modules
- Build script configured to compile TypeScript to dist/ directory
- Development script configured with ts-node-dev or tsx for hot reload during development

### 2. Create Backend Project Directory Structure
Establish a scalable, feature-based directory structure for the backend application following Node.js best practices.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Directory structure created with folders: src/routes, src/controllers, src/services, src/middleware, src/models, src/utils, src/types, src/config, tests/
- Each directory includes an index.ts barrel export file for clean imports
- README.md or structure documentation explains the purpose of each directory
- Structure supports separation of concerns and testability

Dependencies: Story 1

### 3. Install and Configure Express Framework
Install Express.js framework and create a basic application server with TypeScript support and essential middleware.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Express and @types/express installed via npm
- src/app.ts created with Express application instance, CORS, JSON body parser, and basic error handling middleware
- src/server.ts created as entry point that starts HTTP server on configurable port
- Server starts successfully and responds to requests on http://localhost:3000

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story 2

---

### 4. Configure Development Environment Tools
Set up code quality tools including ESLint, Prettier, and EditorConfig for consistent code style across the team.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ESLint configured for TypeScript with recommended rules and Node.js environment
- Prettier installed and configured with consistent formatting rules (matches frontend where applicable)
- EditorConfig file created for editor-agnostic settings
- npm scripts added for linting (lint, lint:fix) and formatting (format, format:check)

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story 2

---

### 5. Create Basic Health Check Endpoint
Implement a simple health check endpoint to verify the server is running and ready to handle requests.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GET /health endpoint returns 200 status with JSON response containing status and timestamp
- Endpoint accessible at http://localhost:3000/health when server running
- Response includes version from package.json and uptime information
- Endpoint does not require authentication

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story 3

---

### 6. Set Up Testing Infrastructure
Configure testing framework and tools for unit and integration testing with TypeScript support.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Jest or Vitest installed with TypeScript support and @types packages
- Test configuration file created (jest.config.js or vitest.config.ts)
- Test setup file created for common test utilities and mocks
- Sample test file created for health check endpoint demonstrating testing patterns
- npm test script runs tests successfully with coverage reporting

Dependencies: Stories 3, 4

---

### 7. Create Backend Documentation
Write comprehensive README.md for the backend project covering installation, development workflow, project structure, and coding standards.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/README.md created with sections: Overview, Prerequisites, Installation, Available Scripts, Project Structure, Development Guidelines, Testing, API Documentation
- Documentation explains how to run development server, build for production, run tests, and run linters
- Coding conventions documented (naming, async/await patterns, error handling, TypeScript usage)
- Cross-references to relevant documentation files

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Stories 5, 6

---

### 8. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Backend
Create GitHub Actions workflow to automate testing, linting, type checking, and building for the backend on pull requests and main branch.

Acceptance Criteria:
- .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml created with jobs for lint, typecheck, test, and build
- Workflow triggers on pull requests and pushes to main branch for backend/ directory changes
- Workflow uses Node.js 20 LTS with dependency caching
- Build fails if any job (lint, typecheck, test, build) fails

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story 7

---

### 9. Add Environment Variable Configuration
Implement environment variable management using dotenv for configuration across different environments.

Acceptance Criteria:
- dotenv package installed and configured to load environment variables
- .env.example file created documenting all required and optional environment variables
- src/config/env.ts created to export typed environment variables with validation
- Environment variables loaded at application startup with error handling for missing required variables

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story 7

---

### 10. Create API Documentation Structure
Set up API documentation foundation using comments or OpenAPI/Swagger specification for future API endpoints.

Acceptance Criteria:
- API documentation approach decided (JSDoc comments, Swagger/OpenAPI, or both)
- If using Swagger: swagger-jsdoc and swagger-ui-express installed and configured
- Health check endpoint documented as example
- Documentation accessible via /api-docs route (if using Swagger) or in docs/ directory
