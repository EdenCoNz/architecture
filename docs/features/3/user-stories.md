# Feature #3: Initialize Backend Project

**Created:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Planning Complete

## Overview
Initialize a backend project under the backend/ folder with all necessary infrastructure, development tooling, testing framework, and CI/CD pipeline. This feature establishes the foundation for building RESTful APIs and backend services that will integrate with the existing React frontend.

## User Stories

### 1. Initialize Backend Project Structure
Create the initial backend project directory structure under backend/ with a modern backend framework and package manager. Set up the basic project scaffold with necessary configuration files.

Acceptance Criteria:
- backend/ directory exists with initialized project
- Package manager configuration file exists with project metadata
- Basic backend framework is installed and configured
- .gitignore file configured for backend-specific files

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: none

### 2. Configure Backend Development Environment
Set up development environment tooling including code quality tools, linters, formatters, and editor configurations to ensure consistent code quality across the team.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Linter is installed and configured with rules
- Code formatter is installed and configured
- EditorConfig file exists for consistent editor settings
- Pre-commit hooks are configured (optional but recommended)

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #1

---

### 3. Create Backend Directory Structure
Establish a scalable, feature-based directory structure for organizing routes, controllers, services, models, middleware, utilities, and configuration files.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Directory structure created with clear separation of concerns
- README or documentation file explains the purpose of each directory
- Structure follows best practices for the chosen backend framework
- Directory organization supports TDD workflow

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #2

---

### 4. Set Up Environment Configuration
Implement environment variable management for different environments (development, test, production) with secure handling of sensitive configuration data.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Environment variable loading mechanism is implemented
- .env.example file exists with all required variables documented
- Different environment configurations are supported
- Sensitive data is excluded from version control

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #3

---

### 5. Configure Database Connection
Set up database connection configuration and connection pooling. Implement database client initialization with proper error handling and connection management.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Database client/ORM is installed and configured
- Connection configuration supports multiple environments
- Connection pooling is configured with appropriate limits
- Database connection errors are properly handled

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #4

---

### 6. Create Basic API Server
Implement the core API server with basic middleware (CORS, body parsing, error handling) and a health check endpoint to verify server functionality.

Acceptance Criteria:
- HTTP server starts successfully on configured port
- Health check endpoint returns 200 status with uptime information
- CORS middleware is configured for frontend integration
- Global error handling middleware is implemented

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #5

---

### 7. Set Up Backend Testing Infrastructure
Configure testing framework and create test setup with utilities for unit tests, integration tests, and API endpoint testing. Establish testing conventions and example tests.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Testing framework is installed and configured
- Test setup file exists with common utilities and mocks
- Test script in package.json runs successfully
- Example test demonstrates testing patterns for routes/controllers

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #6

---

### 8. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Backend
Create GitHub Actions workflow for backend with automated testing, linting, and build verification on pull requests and main branch pushes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GitHub Actions workflow file exists for backend
- Workflow runs tests on PR and main branch events
- Workflow includes linting and code quality checks
- Workflow uses dependency caching for faster builds

Agent: devops-engineer
Dependencies: Story #6

---

### 9. Create Backend Documentation
Write comprehensive README documentation covering setup instructions, project structure, development workflow, testing approach, API conventions, and deployment guidelines.

Acceptance Criteria:
- README.md exists in backend/ directory
- Documentation covers installation and setup steps
- Project structure and directory purposes are explained
- Testing and TDD workflow is documented

Agent: backend-developer
Dependencies: Story #7, Story #8
