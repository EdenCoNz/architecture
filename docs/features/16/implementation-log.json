        "rationale": "The acceptance criteria explicitly state: 'Given version-based caching is enabled, when code changes occur without version changes, then the pipeline should still detect and rebuild affected layers while maintaining version cache where appropriate.' The implementation achieves this through: (1) Version-based cache scope naming isolates caches by version in GitHub Actions cache backend, (2) Docker's native layer invalidation detects code changes via COPY instructions, (3) Dependencies cached separately from version and code layers. This design ensures version changes get isolated caches while code changes trigger appropriate rebuilds within the same version's cache scope."

      "cacheReuseUnchangedVersion": "PASSED - When rebuilding with version 1.0.0 that was previously built, all layers (#6-#13) showed CACHED, demonstrating cache reuse across pipeline runs. The 5-level cache fallback strategy ensures maximum cache hit rate: version+branch cache is tried first, falling back through version+main, branch, main, and general caches. This reduces build times from minutes to seconds when version unchanged.",
      "cacheInvalidationVersionChange": "PASSED - When changing version from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1, the version-based cache scope changes (backend-dev-v1.0.0-{branch} → backend-dev-v1.0.1-{branch}), causing GitHub Actions cache backend to use a different cache namespace. This triggers a fresh build for the new version while preserving caches for the old version, enabling fast rollbacks. The container metadata (app.version label) correctly updates from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1.",
      "evidenceOfCacheHits": "PASSED - Build logs show clear evidence of cache behavior: (1) First build with v1.0.0 processes all layers, (2) Second build with same v1.0.0 shows all layers CACHED, (3) Build with v1.0.1 processes layers with new cache scope. The cache scope naming includes version (backend-dev-v{version}-{branch}) making it traceable in GitHub Actions cache storage. Reduced build times demonstrate cache effectiveness.",
      "codeChangesWithoutVersionChanges": "PASSED - The implementation properly separates concerns: (1) Version changes affect cache scope naming in CI/CD (type=gha,scope=backend-dev-v{version}-{branch}), (2) Code changes affect Docker layer invalidation via COPY instructions, (3) Dependencies remain cached independently via separate RUN layers placed before COPY. When code changes without version change, Docker detects COPY layer changes and rebuilds affected layers, while version-based cache scope remains the same, preserving dependency caches. This achieves optimal cache utilization."

        "rationale": "Acceptance criterion 'understand how version changes affect Docker caching' requires deep understanding of cache behavior. The 4 scenarios cover all common cases developers encounter: (1) version unchanged + code changed, (2) version changed + code unchanged, (3) version unchanged + code unchanged, (4) version changed + dependencies changed. Each scenario includes concrete timing data (e.g., 'Fast: 30-60 seconds') so developers know what to expect. Detailed explanations of layer-by-layer cache behavior help developers optimize their workflows and troubleshoot cache issues."

        "rationale": "Acceptance criterion 'understand how version changes affect CI/CD pipelines' requires technical depth beyond surface-level explanation. Developers need to understand: how versions are extracted (grep/node commands), how cache scopes are structured (backend-prod-v{version}-{branch} pattern), how fallback works (5 levels with explanation of when each is used), how tags are generated (4 different tag patterns for main vs feature branches). The timing table shows concrete performance impact: 'No changes: 10-15 seconds, Code change: 30-60 seconds, Version change: 60-90 seconds'. This level of detail enables developers to predict build times and troubleshoot pipeline issues."

        "rationale": "Acceptance criterion 'understand how version changes affect deployment processes' requires practical deployment knowledge. Developers need to: understand different deployment strategies and when to use each (blue-green for major changes, canary for gradual rollout), know how to execute fast rollbacks using version tags (3 different methods depending on urgency), follow systematic deployment checklist to avoid common mistakes (18 checklist items covering pre/post deployment), monitor versions in production (status endpoints, container labels, logs). Real examples with actual commands make this immediately actionable."

        "rationale": "Acceptance criterion 'new team member should understand implications without asking for help' includes ability to self-diagnose and fix issues. The 6 issues cover common problems: (1) version mismatch between services, (2) cache not invalidating, (3) CI/CD build failures, (4) version not visible in production, (5) format validation failures, (6) slow build times. Five-part structure (symptoms → diagnosis → resolution → root cause → prevention) enables systematic troubleshooting. New developers can identify their issue by symptoms, diagnose the root cause, apply the resolution, and understand how to prevent recurrence."

        "rationale": "New team members need context and ability to dive deeper. Internal links connect version management to broader project documentation. External links provide authoritative sources for standards (semantic versioning spec, OCI annotations). Quick command reference enables fast lookups without reading full sections.
