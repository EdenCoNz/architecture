# Feature #16: Application Version Management

## Feature Overview

**Feature ID**: 16
**Title**: Application Version Management
**Created**: 2025-10-28

### Description

Enable developers and operators to track application versions across frontend and backend components using semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format), with version information stored in standard package management files and automatically integrated into Docker build processes and CI/CD workflows to control build cache invalidation and enable version-aware deployments.

### Business Value

- Clear version tracking across all application components
- Automated cache invalidation when versions change
- Improved deployment traceability and rollback capabilities
- Consistent versioning strategy across frontend and backend
- Faster builds when versions unchanged (cache utilization)
- Better incident response through version identification

## User Stories

### Story 16.1: Store Frontend Version

**Title**: Store Frontend Version
**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Story ID**: Story-16.1

**Description**:
As a developer, I want the frontend application version to be stored in the package manifest file so that version information is centrally managed using standard tooling and follows ecosystem conventions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I open the frontend package manifest, when I view the version field, then I should see "1.0.0" as the initial version
- Given the package manifest has a version field, when I run package manager commands, then the version should be recognized and used by the tooling
- Given the version is stored in the manifest, when other developers check out the code, then they can immediately identify the frontend version without searching multiple files
- Given the manifest contains the version, when I need to increment the version, then I can update a single, well-known location

**Dependencies**: None

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

### Story 16.2: Store Backend Version

**Title**: Store Backend Version
**Agent**: backend-developer
**Story ID**: Story-16.2

**Description**:
As a developer, I want the backend application version to be stored in the application initialization file so that version information is accessible to the application runtime and all backend services can report consistent version data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I open the backend initialization file, when I view the version constant or variable, then I should see "1.0.0" as the initial version
- Given the version is defined in the initialization file, when any backend service starts, then it can import and access the version information
- Given the version is stored centrally, when multiple backend services need version info, then they all reference the same authoritative source
- Given the initialization file contains the version, when I need to update the version, then all backend services automatically use the new version without individual updates

**Dependencies**: None

### Story 16.3: Frontend Container Builds Use Version for Cache Control

**Title**: Frontend Container Builds Use Version for Cache Control
**Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story ID**: Story-16.3

**Description**:
As a developer, I want the frontend container build process to incorporate the application version so that Docker layer caching is automatically invalidated when the version changes, ensuring fresh builds for new releases while maximizing cache reuse for unchanged versions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the frontend version is "1.0.0", when I build the frontend container twice without changing the version, then subsequent builds should reuse cached layers for faster build times
- Given I change the frontend version from "1.0.0" to "1.0.1", when I build the frontend container, then Docker should invalidate the cache and rebuild layers to ensure the new version is properly incorporated
- Given the version hasn't changed but code has, when I build the container, then code changes should still trigger appropriate cache invalidation independent of version
- Given I inspect a built frontend container, when I check the container metadata or labels, then I should be able to identify which application version was built into the image

**Dependencies**: Story-16.1

**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

### Story 16.4: Backend Container Builds Use Version for Cache Control

**Title**: Backend Container Builds Use Version for Cache Control
**Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story ID**: Story-16.4

**Description**:
As a developer, I want the backend container build process to incorporate the application version so that Docker layer caching is automatically invalidated when the version changes, ensuring fresh builds for new releases while maximizing cache reuse for unchanged versions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the backend version is "1.0.0", when I build the backend container twice without changing the version, then subsequent builds should reuse cached layers for faster build times
- Given I change the backend version from "1.0.0" to "1.0.1", when I build the backend container, then Docker should invalidate the cache and rebuild layers to ensure the new version is properly incorporated
- Given the version hasn't changed but code has, when I build the container, then code changes should still trigger appropriate cache invalidation independent of version
- Given I inspect a built backend container, when I check the container metadata or labels, then I should be able to identify which application version was built into the image

### Story 16.5: CI Pipeline Respects Version-Based Caching

**Title**: CI Pipeline Respects Version-Based Caching
**Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story ID**: Story-16.5

**Description**:
As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to utilize version information when building containers so that unchanged versions benefit from build cache across pipeline runs, reducing build times while ensuring version changes trigger complete rebuilds.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I push code with version "1.0.0" that was previously built in CI, when the pipeline builds containers, then it should reuse cached layers from previous builds of the same version
- Given I push code with a new version "1.0.1", when the pipeline builds containers, then it should invalidate version-dependent caches and perform a fresh build
- Given multiple CI pipeline runs occur with the same version, when reviewing build logs, then I should see evidence of cache hits and reduced build times for unchanged versions
- Given version-based caching is enabled, when code changes occur without version changes, then the pipeline should still detect and rebuild affected layers while maintaining version cache where appropriate

**Dependencies**: Story-16.3, Story-16.4

### Story 16.6: Expose Frontend Version at Runtime

**Title**: Expose Frontend Version at Runtime
**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Story ID**: Story-16.6

**Description**:
As a support engineer or administrator, I want to view the frontend application version from a running application so that I can verify which version is deployed, troubleshoot version-related issues, and confirm successful deployments.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the frontend application is running, when I access a version information endpoint or interface, then I should see the current application version displayed (e.g., "1.0.0")
- Given I am troubleshooting an issue, when I check the browser console or developer tools, then the application version should be visible or easily accessible
- Given multiple frontend deployments exist (local, staging, production), when I check each environment, then each should accurately report its deployed version
- Given the version is exposed at runtime, when the application updates to a new version, then the displayed version should automatically reflect the new version without manual configuration

**Dependencies**: Story-16.1

### Story 16.7: Expose Backend Version Through Status Endpoint

**Title**: Expose Backend Version Through Status Endpoint
**Agent**: backend-developer
**Story ID**: Story-16.7

**Description**:
As a support engineer or monitoring system, I want to query the backend application version through a status endpoint so that I can programmatically verify deployed versions, track version history, and integrate version information into monitoring dashboards.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the backend is running, when I send a request to the status endpoint, then the response should include the current application version (e.g., "version": "1.0.0")
- Given I query the status endpoint, when I parse the response, then the version information should be in a standard, machine-readable format
- Given multiple backend instances are running, when I query each instance's status endpoint, then all instances should report the same version if they're from the same deployment
- Given the backend version changes, when I query the status endpoint after deployment, then it should immediately reflect the new version without requiring service restart beyond the deployment restart

**Dependencies**: Story-16.2

### Story 16.8: Version Information in Container Labels

**Title**: Version Information in Container Labels
**Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story ID**: Story-16.8

**Description**:
As an operator, I want container images to include application version information in their metadata labels so that I can identify which application version is running in any container without needing to inspect the application itself.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I inspect a frontend container image, when I view the image labels, then I should see a label containing the frontend application version (e.g., "app.version=1.0.0")
- Given I inspect a backend container image, when I view the image labels, then I should see a label containing the backend application version (e.g., "app.version=1.0.0")
- Given containers are running in any environment, when I list running containers with label filters, then I can filter and identify containers by application version
- Given multiple container images exist, when I query the container registry or local images, then I can identify the newest version by comparing version labels

**Dependencies**: Story-16.3, Story-16.4

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

### Story 16.9: Document Version Management Process

**Title**: Document Version Management Process
**Agent**: devops-engineer
**Story ID**: Story-16.9

**Description**:
As a developer, I want clear documentation on how to manage application versions so that I understand when and how to increment versions, what impact version changes have on builds and deployments, and how to follow the semantic versioning convention correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I need to increment the version, when I read the version management documentation, then I should understand how to update versions in both frontend and backend
- Given I want to understand semantic versioning, when I consult the documentation, then I should see clear explanations of MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH increments with examples
- Given I'm planning a release, when I review the documentation, then I should understand how version changes affect Docker caching, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment processes
- Given I'm a new team member, when I read the version management docs, then I should be able to successfully update versions and understand the implications without asking for help

## Notes

### Semantic Versioning Convention (1.2.3)
- **MAJOR (1)**: Breaking changes that require user/API consumer updates
- **MINOR (2)**: New features added in backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH (3)**: Bug fixes and backward-compatible improvements

### Initial Versions
- Frontend starts at: **1.0.0**
- Backend starts at: **1.0.0**

### Cache Control Strategy
Version information serves as a cache-busting mechanism in Docker builds. When version remains unchanged, Docker can safely reuse cached layers. When version increments, Docker rebuilds to ensure fresh artifacts.

### Implementation Flexibility
These stories intentionally avoid specifying:
- Where exactly in files versions are stored
- Specific Docker ARG/LABEL implementation details
- Exact CI/CD cache configuration
- Frontend version display location (console, UI, endpoint)
- Backend endpoint paths

These details are left to the implementing agents' expertise and technical judgment.
