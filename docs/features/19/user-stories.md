# Feature 19: Equipment Assessment Single Selection with Conditional Follow-up

## Feature Overview
**Title:** Equipment Assessment Single Selection with Conditional Follow-up
**Description:** Enable users to accurately specify their available training equipment through a single-selection equipment assessment with conditional follow-up prompts for basic equipment, allowing users to indicate specific equipment items from predefined options or custom entries, ensuring the system generates appropriate training programs based on actual equipment availability.

**User Benefit:** More accurate equipment specification leads to better-tailored training programs that match what users actually have available, while simplified single-selection reduces decision complexity.

**Feature Context:** This modifies the existing equipment assessment (Story 11.6 from Feature #11) to change from multiple selection to single selection, and adds conditional follow-up for basic equipment specification.

## User Stories

### Story 19.1: Design Single Selection Equipment Assessment
**As a** new user
**I want to** see equipment options that clearly indicate I can only select one
**So that** I understand I should choose the option that best describes my equipment availability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When I view equipment options, I should see visual indicators that only one option can be selected (e.g., radio button pattern)
- When I select an equipment level, any previously selected option should automatically be deselected
- When I view the equipment options, I should see clear descriptions of each level (e.g., "No equipment - bodyweight only", "Basic equipment - minimal gear", "Full gym - complete equipment access")
- When I haven't selected any equipment option, the interface should clearly indicate this is a required selection
