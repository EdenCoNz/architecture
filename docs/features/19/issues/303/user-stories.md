# Fix Stories for Issue #303: API Test Component Test Failures

## Issue Context
- **Issue #303**: CI/CD Pipeline Failed: Build and Test - Run #97
- **Branch**: feature/19-equipment-assessment-single-selection-with-item-input
- **Category**: Test Failures
- **Total Failures**: 18 failing tests in ApiTest.test.tsx

## Root Cause Analysis
All 18 failing tests are in `frontend/src/pages/ApiTest/ApiTest.test.tsx` and relate to Stories 10.3 and 10.4 (API call functionality and response display). The tests are failing because the fetch spy is not being called - expected 1 call but received 0.

The ApiTest component implementation exists and appears correct, but the tests cannot verify that fetch is being called when the button is clicked. This indicates either:
1. The fetch mock setup is incorrect
2. The tests need to properly import and mock the service layer
3. The button click handler is not awaiting properly in tests

## User Stories

### Story 1: Fix API Test Mock Setup for Fetch Calls
**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Priority**: High
**Type**: Bug Fix

**Description**:
As a developer, I need the API test component tests to properly mock and verify fetch calls so that I can ensure the component correctly makes HTTP requests when the test button is clicked.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. All 18 failing tests in `frontend/src/pages/ApiTest/ApiTest.test.tsx` pass successfully
2. Tests correctly verify that fetch is called when the button is clicked
3. Tests verify fetch is called with correct URL endpoint
4. Tests verify fetch is called with proper HTTP headers
5. Loading states are properly tested (button disabled, loading text, spinner)
6. Response display tests pass (success message, backend message content, timestamp)
7. Error handling tests pass
8. No new test failures are introduced

**Technical Context**:
- Component under test: `frontend/src/pages/ApiTest/ApiTest.tsx`
- Test file: `frontend/src/pages/ApiTest/ApiTest.test.tsx`
- Service being called: `testBackendConnection` from `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Current mock setup uses `global.fetch = vi.fn()` but this may not be intercepting the actual fetch calls
- Consider mocking the service layer (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`) instead of global fetch
- Ensure async operations complete before assertions using `waitFor`
- Component uses Material-UI components and React Testing Library

**Implementation Guidance**:
1. Review how fetch is being mocked in the test setup
2. Consider using `vi.mock('../../services/api')` to mock the service layer instead
3. Ensure proper async/await handling in tests
4. Verify userEvent.click() operations wait for async handlers to complete
5. Use waitFor() for assertions that depend on async state updates
6. Follow existing test patterns from other passing tests in the codebase

**Files to Modify**:
- `frontend/src/pages/ApiTest/ApiTest.test.tsx` - Fix mock setup and test implementation

**Testing Requirements**:
- All 18 currently failing tests must pass
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- Verify CI/CD pipeline build and test job passes

## Success Metrics
- All tests in `frontend/src/pages/ApiTest/ApiTest.test.tsx` pass (37/37)
- CI/CD pipeline Build and Test job succeeds
- No regression in other test files
