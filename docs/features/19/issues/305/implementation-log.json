      "status": "completed",
      "completedAt": "2025-11-01T07:10:00Z",
      "rootCause": "Code formatting violations in frontend test files - extra spaces and indentation that didn't match Prettier configuration, primarily in AssessmentForm.test.tsx (37 errors on lines 654-900)",
      "solution": "Ran `npm run lint:fix` in frontend directory to automatically fix all 45 prettier/prettier formatting errors using ESLint's auto-fix capability",
      "impact": "CI/CD pipeline was blocked preventing deployment. All developers on feature/19 branch were unable to merge changes until formatting issues were resolved",

      "rootCause": "ESLint no-console rule violations - 11 console.log statements in version utility files that violated project's linting rules (only console.warn and console.error allowed)",
      "solution": "Added eslint-disable-next-line no-console comments for legitimate console.log usage in logVersionInfo function (startup logging) and test assertions that verify console logging behavior. These console statements are intentional and necessary for their purpose",
      "impact": "Code quality warnings that could accumulate over time, though warnings didn't block builds in this configuration",

      "technicalDecisions": [
        "Chose to suppress warnings with eslint-disable-next-line rather than remove console.log statements because: (1) logVersionInfo is intentionally designed to log version info on startup for debugging/support, (2) test assertions legitimately need to verify console.log was called"
