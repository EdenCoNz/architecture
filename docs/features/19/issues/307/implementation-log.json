          "description": "Increased test timeout from default 15s to 20s for complex multi-step equipment selection test"
        }
      ],
      "rootCause": {
        "description": "Test 'should deselect previous equipment level when selecting a new one' involves complex multi-step interaction (filling 5 required fields, selecting equipment, submitting form, switching equipment, selecting items, submitting again) that takes 7-8 seconds to complete locally. In CI environment with potentially slower execution, this occasionally exceeded the default 15-second timeout.",
        "category": "test-configuration"
      },
      "solution": {
        "description": "Added explicit 20-second timeout to the test using Vitest's timeout parameter. This provides sufficient buffer for the complex multi-step interaction while still catching actual hangs or infinite loops.",
        "approach": "Test timeout configuration",
        "reasoning": "The test logic and component behavior are correct - the test passes reliably but needs more time for the extensive interaction flow. Increasing timeout is appropriate for legitimately long-running integration tests."
      },
      "verification": {
        "method": "Local test execution",
        "results": "All 33 AssessmentForm tests pass, including the fixed test which now completes in 6.4-7.9 seconds with the 20-second timeout buffer"
      }
