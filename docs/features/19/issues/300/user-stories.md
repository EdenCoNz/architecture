# Issue #300: CI/CD Pipeline Failed - Build and Test Run #94

**Issue Number:** #300
**Feature:** 19 - Equipment Assessment Single Selection with Conditional Follow-up
**Branch:** feature/19-equipment-assessment-single-selection-with-item-input
**Created:** 2025-11-01
**Total Stories:** 3

## Issue Summary

CI/CD pipeline failed with 18 test failures across three categories:
1. **Startup Scripts Tests (16 failures)** - Tests expect legacy startup scripts that were archived in Feature #15
2. **Equipment Migration Test (1 failure)** - Migration details tracking not recording data correctly
3. **Frontend Config Test (1 failure)** - Default API URL returns empty string instead of expected "http://localhost:8000"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Startup Scripts (16 failures)
The acceptance tests for Story #13 still expect legacy startup scripts (dev.sh, prod.sh, test.sh, seed.sh) in `/backend/scripts/`. These scripts were intentionally archived to `/archive/legacy-backend-scripts/` during Feature #15 when Docker Compose replaced the standalone script-based workflow. The tests need to be updated to reflect this architectural change.

### Equipment Migration (1 failure)
Test `test_migration_details_tracking` expects `migration_details` list to be populated when migrating assessments, but the current implementation appears to not be storing detail records correctly for all migration scenarios.

### Frontend Config (1 failure)
Test `test_frontend_config_default_values` expects the frontend configuration endpoint to return `"url": "http://localhost:8000"` when `FRONTEND_API_URL` environment variable is not set. However, the current implementation (line 99 of config_views.py) intentionally returns an empty string to allow the frontend to use same-origin requests through the nginx reverse proxy. This is a test expectation mismatch with the intentional implementation.

## User Stories

### Story 300.1: Update Startup Scripts Acceptance Tests for Docker Workflow

**Assigned Agent:** backend-developer

**Description:**
As a developer running the CI/CD pipeline, I need the startup scripts acceptance tests to reflect the current Docker-based workflow architecture, so that tests accurately verify the actual system design rather than failing on intentionally archived components.

**Context:**
Feature #15 deliberately moved from standalone shell scripts to Docker Compose orchestration. The SCRIPTS.md documentation clearly states scripts were archived and replaced. The acceptance tests in `test_story13_startup_scripts.py` still verify the old architecture, causing 16 test failures that don't represent actual defects.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given I run the acceptance test suite, when the startup scripts tests execute, then all 16 tests should pass by verifying the current Docker-based workflow instead of archived scripts
- Given the tests verify Docker workflow, when I check test coverage, then the tests should validate that docker-dev.sh provides equivalent functionality (start server, run tests, seed database, production mode)
- Given SCRIPTS.md documents the architectural change, when tests run, then they should verify the documentation correctly explains the Docker workflow replacement
- Given the tests pass, when I review test output, then the tests should confirm Docker Compose handles development server startup, production deployment, testing, and database seeding

**Technical Notes:**
- Tests are located at: `/backend/tests/acceptance/test_story13_startup_scripts.py`
- Current scripts directory: `/backend/scripts/` (contains only verify_tools.sh)
- Archived scripts location: `/archive/legacy-backend-scripts/`
- Active workflow: docker-dev.sh and Docker Compose configurations
- SCRIPTS.md documents the migration and current workflow

### Story 300.2: Fix Equipment Migration Details Tracking

**Assigned Agent:** backend-developer

**Description:**
As a system administrator running data migrations, I need the equipment migration process to correctly record detailed information about each migrated assessment, so that I can audit migration results and troubleshoot any issues with specific user data.

**Context:**
The `EquipmentMigrator` class in `/backend/apps/assessments/management/commands/migrate_equipment_data.py` is supposed to track details of every migration operation in the `migration_details` list. The test `test_migration_details_tracking` creates an assessment with list-based equipment data and expects the migrator to record the migration, but the detail record is not being created correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given I migrate an assessment with multiple equipment selections, when the migration completes, then the migration_details list should contain exactly one entry with the assessment's user_id, user_email, status, original_equipment, and new_equipment
- Given the detail entry is created, when I inspect it, then the original_equipment field should show the list format and new_equipment should show the converted single-selection string
- Given I run the test suite, when the test_migration_details_tracking test executes, then it should pass without assertion errors
- Given multiple assessments are migrated, when I check migration_details, then each assessment should have exactly one corresponding detail entry with accurate before and after states

**Technical Notes:**
- File: `/backend/apps/assessments/management/commands/migrate_equipment_data.py`
- Test: `/backend/tests/integration/test_migrate_equipment_data.py::TestEquipmentMigrator::test_migration_details_tracking`
- The migrator already has logic to append to migration_details in various code paths
- Need to verify all code paths correctly populate the detail records

### Story 300.3: Align Frontend Config Test with Intentional Empty URL Design

**Assigned Agent:** backend-developer

**Description:**
As a developer maintaining test quality, I need the frontend configuration endpoint tests to match the intentional same-origin design, so that tests verify the actual architectural decision rather than failing on correct behavior.

**Context:**
The frontend configuration endpoint intentionally returns an empty string for API URL when `FRONTEND_API_URL` is not set. This allows the frontend to make same-origin requests through the nginx reverse proxy, enabling the same container image to work across different network configurations without rebuilding. The test expects "http://localhost:8000" but this contradicts the documented design in config_views.py lines 88-98.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given FRONTEND_API_URL is not set, when I call the frontend config endpoint, then the response should contain `"url": ""` (empty string) to enable same-origin requests
- Given the test suite runs, when test_frontend_config_default_values executes, then it should pass by expecting empty string as the correct default behavior
- Given the implementation has detailed comments explaining the design, when tests run, then they should validate the same-origin proxy pattern works as intended
- Given I review the test, when I check assertions, then they should verify that empty URL enables frontend to use localhost/network IP through proxy without rebuilding

**Technical Notes:**
- Implementation: `/backend/apps/api/config_views.py` (line 99: returns empty string by design)
- Test: `/backend/tests/integration/test_frontend_config.py::TestFrontendConfigEndpoint::test_frontend_config_default_values`
- Design rationale documented in config_views.py lines 88-98
- Empty string is intentional, not a bug - allows same container image to work on localhost and network IPs
- Test expectations need updating to match documented architecture
