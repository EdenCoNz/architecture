      "root_cause": "The acceptance tests in test_story13_startup_scripts.py were written to verify the legacy shell script architecture (dev.sh, prod.sh, test.sh, seed.sh) that was intentionally archived during Feature #15. The tests checked for files in /backend/scripts/ that no longer exist in the active workflow. This caused 16 test failures that didn't represent actual system defects, but rather incorrect test expectations.",
      "solution": "Rewrote all 16 acceptance tests to verify the Docker Compose-based workflow that replaced the shell scripts. The updated tests verify: (1) docker-dev.sh exists and provides equivalent development functionality, (2) docker-compose.yml has volume mounts for hot reload, (3) compose.production.yml provides production-optimized settings, (4) compose.test.yml provides test environment, (5) Docker Compose architecture supports all original script functions (dev server start, production deployment, testing, database seeding), (6) SCRIPTS.md documents the Docker migration and current workflow.",
