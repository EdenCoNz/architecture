# Issue #302: CI/CD Pipeline Failed - Equipment Migration Test Data Type Mismatch

**Issue**: CI/CD Pipeline Failed: Build and Test - Run #96
**Feature**: #19 - Equipment Assessment Single Selection with Conditional Follow-up
**Branch**: feature/19-equipment-assessment-single-selection-with-item-input
**Status**: Fix Required

## Problem Summary

The equipment migration integration test is failing because it attempts to create an Assessment with equipment data in the old list format (`["no_equipment", "full_gym"]`) while the database schema now expects a single string value (max 20 characters) after Feature #19 implementation changed the equipment field from JSONField to CharField with choices.

## Root Cause Analysis

Feature #19 migrated the equipment field from supporting multiple selections (list) to single selection (string with choices: "no_equipment", "basic_equipment", "full_gym"). The integration test `test_migration_details_tracking` still uses test data in the old format, causing a database constraint violation when Django ORM attempts to save the list as a string value.

**Error**: `psycopg2.errors.StringDataRightTruncation: value too long for type character varying(20)`
**Location**: `backend/tests/integration/test_migrate_equipment_data.py:255`

## User Stories

### Story-302.1: Update Equipment Migration Test to Use Current Schema

**Title**: Update Equipment Migration Test to Use Current Schema

**As a**: developer
**I want**: the equipment migration integration test to use the current single-selection equipment format
**So that**: the test suite accurately validates the migration logic against the actual database schema

**Description**:
The equipment migration integration test needs to create Assessment records using the current schema format. Since Feature #19 changed equipment from multi-select (list) to single-select (string), the test data must use valid single string values from the Equipment choices ("no_equipment", "basic_equipment", "full_gym") instead of list values.

The test validates that the migration process correctly handles equipment data, so it should create test scenarios using the actual data format the migration will encounter.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the test creates an Assessment, when setting the equipment field, then it should use a single string value from Equipment choices
- Given the test runs the migration, when validating migration details, then all assertions should pass without database constraint errors
- Given the test data uses current schema format, when the test suite runs, then the `test_migration_details_tracking` test should pass
- Given the test validates migration behavior, when equipment data is processed, then the test should verify the migration handles both the original format and the new format correctly
