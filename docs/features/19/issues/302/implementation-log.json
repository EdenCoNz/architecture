    "root_cause": "Feature #19 changed the equipment field from a JSONField (list/multi-select) to a CharField with max_length=20 and specific choices ('no_equipment', 'basic_equipment', 'full_gym'). The test_migration_details_tracking test was still attempting to create Assessment records with equipment as a list value (['no_equipment', 'full_gym']), which violates the database schema constraint. This caused a psycopg2.errors.StringDataRightTruncation error when Django ORM tried to save the list as a string.",
