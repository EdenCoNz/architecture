# Fix Stories for Issue #304: CI/CD Pipeline Failed - Build and Test Run #98

## Issue Context

- **Issue Number**: #304
- **Type**: CI/CD Test Failures
- **Feature**: 19 - Equipment Assessment Single Selection with Conditional Follow-up
- **Branch**: feature/19-equipment-assessment-single-selection-with-item-input
- **Failed Job**: Build and Test Complete Stack

## Error Summary

Two test failures in AssessmentForm component:
1. Submit button loading state not working - button remains enabled during submission
2. Equipment selection interaction timeout - test times out after 15 seconds waiting for deselection behavior

**Business Impact**: Users could accidentally submit forms multiple times, and equipment selection may feel unresponsive or broken.

## User Stories

### Story 304.1: Fix Submit Button Loading State

**Assigned Agent**: frontend-developer

**Description**

As a developer maintaining the assessment form, I need the submit button to properly disable during form submission, so that users cannot accidentally submit the form multiple times while a submission is in progress.

**Context**

The test "should show loading state during form submission" expects the submit button to be disabled when the form is being submitted, but the button remains enabled. This creates a poor user experience where users could click submit multiple times, potentially creating duplicate submissions.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Given the user has filled out all required form fields, when they click the submit button, then the button should immediately become disabled
2. Given the form is being submitted, when the user looks at the submit button, then it should show a loading indicator
3. Given the form submission completes successfully, when the confirmation message appears, then the submit button state should be managed appropriately
4. Given the form submission fails with an error, when the error message is displayed, then the submit button should become enabled again to allow retry

**Test Requirements**

- The test at src/components/forms/AssessmentForm.test.tsx:143 should pass
- Test: "AssessmentForm > Form Submission > should show loading state during form submission"

**Notes**

- This is a frontend state management issue
- Focus on the submit button's disabled state during async operations
- Ensure the loading state is visible to users

### Story 304.2: Fix Equipment Selection Deselection Performance

**Assigned Agent**: frontend-developer

**Description**

As a developer maintaining the equipment selection feature, I need the equipment selection interaction to complete quickly and reliably, so that the test suite can verify the deselection behavior without timing out.

**Context**

The test "should deselect previous equipment level when selecting a new one (Story 19.4 AC 1)" is timing out after 15 seconds. This indicates either a performance issue or a logic problem where the deselection behavior isn't completing as expected.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Given a user has selected one equipment level, when they click a different equipment level, then the previous selection should be immediately deselected
2. Given the equipment selection state is updated, when the UI renders, then the visual state should update within a reasonable time (< 1 second)
3. Given the equipment deselection logic runs, when the test waits for the state change, then it should complete well before the 15-second timeout
4. Given the deselection behavior is implemented, when automated tests run, then all equipment selection tests should pass without timeouts

**Test Requirements**

- The test should pass without timeout
- Test: "AssessmentForm > Equipment Selection - Story 19.4 (Single Selection) > should deselect previous equipment level when selecting a new one (Story 19.4 AC 1)"
- All other equipment selection tests should continue to pass

**Notes**

- This is related to Story 19.4's single selection requirement
- May involve state management, event handling, or rendering performance
- The timeout suggests either a missing state update or an event that's not firing
- Check for any async operations that might not be completing

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Parallel Fixes
- Story 304.1: Fix Submit Button Loading State (frontend-developer)
- Story 304.2: Fix Equipment Selection Deselection Performance (frontend-developer)

**Rationale**: These are independent fixes in different parts of the same component, so they can be implemented in parallel.

## Story Assignment Summary

- **frontend-developer**: 2 stories (304.1, 304.2)
