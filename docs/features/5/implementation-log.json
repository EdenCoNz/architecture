Security features include path sanitization (validatePathInProjectRoot) and sensitive file detection (validateGitCanCommit). Performance optimized with bash tests for fast file system checks and lazy JSON parsing (syntax check before schema check). Atomicity ensured with validate-then-write pattern and optional backup strategies for critical file overwrites."
