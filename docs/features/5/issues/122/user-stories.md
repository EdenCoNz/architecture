# Fix #122: TypeScript Type Check Failure - JSX Tag Mismatch

## Overview
The frontend application's TypeScript build is failing due to a JSX syntax error in the App.tsx file. The opening tag for BrowserRouter is misspelled as "BrowserRaefsouter", causing a mismatch with the closing tag. This prevents the application from building and blocks the CI/CD pipeline. The fix will restore the correct component name to enable successful builds and deployments.

## User Stories

### 1. Correct JSX Component Tag Syntax
The application's routing functionality is broken due to a misspelled component tag in the main application file. Users cannot access the application because the build fails. Fixing the component tag name will restore the build process and allow users to access the application through their browser.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the application build process runs, when TypeScript compilation executes, then the build should complete successfully without JSX tag mismatch errors
- Given the application is deployed, when users navigate to the application URL, then the routing system should function correctly and display the appropriate pages
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs, when the TypeScript type check step executes, then it should pass without errors

## Notes

### Fix Context
This is a FIX MODE operation for feature #5 (Hello Button on Main Page), addressing issue #122. The error is a simple typo that broke the TypeScript build pipeline. The fix requires correcting the misspelled JSX opening tag from "BrowserRaefsouter" to "BrowserRouter" in the App.tsx file at line 23.

### Story Quality Guidelines
- Generic and implementation-agnostic (no frameworks, libraries, technologies)
- User-focused (describes WHAT users need, not HOW to build it)
- Atomic (1-3 days max, independently deployable)
- Testable (acceptance criteria are user-observable behaviors)
