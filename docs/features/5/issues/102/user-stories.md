# Fix: Issue #102 - ESLint Errors Blocking CI/CD Pipeline

## Issue Details
- **Issue**: #102
- **Type**: validation-failure
- **Original Title**: Workflow Failure: Frontend CI/CD - Lint and Format Check - Run ESLint
- **Feature**: #5 (Add Simple Button that Says Hello on Main Page)
- **Branch**: feature/5-add-simple-button-that-says-hello-on-main-page

## Root Cause Analysis
The ESLint check is failing due to:
1. JSX syntax error in App.tsx - mismatched opening/closing tags preventing parsing
2. TypeScript warning in tests/setup.ts - use of 'any' type triggering linter warning

## Fix Stories

### 1. Resolve JSX Tag Mismatch in Application Root
Fix the JSX syntax error that prevents the application from being parsed correctly by ESLint.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When ESLint runs on App.tsx, no parsing errors should occur
- When the application code is parsed, opening and closing JSX tags should match
- When the lint command runs, it should complete without syntax errors
- CI/CD pipeline lint step should pass successfully

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

### 2. Fix Type Safety Issue in Test Configuration
Resolve the TypeScript type warning in the test setup file to ensure code quality standards are met.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When ESLint runs on setup.ts, no TypeScript warnings should occur
- When the full lint command runs, all files should pass without warnings or errors
- CI/CD pipeline should complete the lint step successfully

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story #1

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: frontend-developer) - Fix JSX tag mismatch (CRITICAL - blocks parsing)
- Story #2 (agent: frontend-developer) - Fix type safety warning

---

## Notes
- Story #1 is critical and must be fixed first as it causes a parsing error that blocks other checks
- Story #2 addresses a code quality warning that should be resolved for clean CI/CD
- Both stories are minimal fixes targeting specific linting errors identified in the workflow failure
