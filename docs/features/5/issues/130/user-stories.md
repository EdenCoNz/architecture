# Fix for Issue #130: JSX Parsing Error in App.tsx

## Overview
The frontend CI/CD pipeline is failing during ESLint validation due to a JSX syntax error in the App.tsx component. The opening tag on line 30 contains a typo ("Boxsas" instead of "Box"), causing ESLint to fail when it encounters the closing tag on line 57. This blocks the deployment pipeline and must be resolved to restore CI/CD functionality.

**Issue Details**:
- Issue Number: 130
- Feature ID: 5
- Branch: feature/5-add-simple-button-that-says-hello-on-main-page
- Failed Step: Run ESLint
- Error Location: frontend/src/App.tsx, line 57

## User Stories

### 1. Fix JSX Tag Name Typo in Application Shell
The application shell component has a typo in the JSX tag name that prevents the code from passing validation. The opening tag uses an incorrect component name, causing a mismatch with the closing tag and breaking the linting process.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the ESLint validation runs, when it processes App.tsx, then it should complete without parsing errors
- Given the application builds, when the corrected code is compiled, then the build should succeed without JSX syntax errors
- Given the frontend CI/CD workflow runs, when it reaches the "Run ESLint" step, then the step should complete successfully with exit code 0

## Technical Context for Agent

**Root Cause**: Line 30 in /home/ed/Dev/architecture/frontend/src/App.tsx contains `<Boxsas` which should be `<Box>`. This typo causes ESLint to report "Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'Boxsas'" at line 57 where the proper closing tag `</Box>` exists.

**Files Affected**:
- /home/ed/Dev/architecture/frontend/src/App.tsx (line 30)

**Expected Fix**: Correct the component name from "Boxsas" to "Box" on line 30 to match the Material-UI Box component import and its closing tag.
