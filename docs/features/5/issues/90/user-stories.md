# Fix: Issue #90 - ESLint Errors in Test Files

## Issue Details
- **Issue**: #90
- **Type**: validation-failure
- **Original Title**: Workflow Failure: Frontend CI/CD - Lint and Format Check - Run ESLint
- **Feature**: #5 (Hello Button on Main Page)
- **Branch**: feature/5-add-simple-button-that-says-hello-on-main-page

## Error Summary
ESLint detected 16 problems (15 errors, 1 warning) across test files:
- 5 formatting errors in Home.test.tsx (prettier/prettier)
- 10 unused variable errors in App.test.tsx and Home.test.tsx (@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars)
- 1 warning about 'any' type usage in setup.ts (@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any)

## Fix Stories

### 1. Resolve Code Formatting Issues in Test Files
Fix all code formatting violations detected by prettier in test files to comply with project code style standards.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When ESLint runs on the test files, no prettier/prettier errors should occur
- When the lint check runs in CI/CD, formatting validation should pass
- Code formatting should be consistent with project standards across all affected files

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

### 2. Remove Unused Variables from Test Files
Clean up unused variables in test files to eliminate code quality warnings and errors.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When ESLint runs, no @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars errors should occur
- When the full test suite runs, all tests should still pass
- Code should only declare variables that are actively used in assertions or test logic

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: frontend-developer) - Fix formatting issues
- Story #2 (agent: frontend-developer) - Remove unused variables

---

## Validation

When both stories are complete:
- ESLint should run without errors (the 1 warning about 'any' type can remain)
- CI/CD lint job should pass
- All existing tests should continue to pass
