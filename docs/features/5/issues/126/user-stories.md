# Fix #126: TypeScript Type Check Failure - JSX Tag Mismatch

## Overview
The frontend application's TypeScript build is failing due to a JSX syntax error in the App.tsx file. The opening tag for the Box component is misspelled as "Boxees" on line 30, causing a mismatch with the closing tag on line 57. This prevents the application from building and blocks the CI/CD pipeline. The fix will restore the correct component name to enable successful builds and deployments.

## User Stories

### 1. Correct Container Component Tag Syntax
The application's layout structure is broken due to a misspelled component tag in the main application shell. Users cannot access the application because the build fails during the type check phase. Fixing the component tag name will restore the build process and allow users to access the application with its proper layout structure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the application build process runs, when TypeScript compilation executes, then the build should complete successfully without JSX tag mismatch errors for the container component
- Given the application is deployed, when users navigate to the application URL, then the main content area should render correctly with proper layout and styling
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs, when the TypeScript type check step executes, then it should pass without "Expected corresponding JSX closing tag" errors

## Notes

### Fix Context
This is a FIX MODE operation for feature #5 (Hello Button on Main Page), addressing issue #126. The error is a simple typo that broke the TypeScript build pipeline. The fix requires correcting the misspelled JSX opening tag from "Boxees" to "Box" in the App.tsx file at line 30, which will properly match the closing tag at line 57.

**Error Details**:
- File: src/App.tsx
- Line: 57, Column: 11
- Error Code: TS17002
- Error Message: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'Boxees'
- Root Cause: Opening tag typo on line 30

### Story Quality Guidelines
- Generic and implementation-agnostic (no frameworks, libraries, technologies)
- User-focused (describes WHAT users need, not HOW to build it)
- Atomic (1-3 days max, independently deployable)
- Testable (acceptance criteria are user-observable behaviors)
