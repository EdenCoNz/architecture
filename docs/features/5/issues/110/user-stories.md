# Issue #110: Workflow Failure - Frontend Build Error

## Overview
Resolve a syntax error in the application routing component that is preventing the frontend from building and running tests successfully. The error prevents users from accessing the application and blocks the deployment pipeline.

## Root Cause
A typo in the routing component tag name causes the build process to fail due to mismatched opening and closing tags.

## Fix User Stories

### 1. Correct Routing Component Syntax
Fix the syntax error in the application routing structure so that the application can build successfully and users can navigate between pages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When the application is built, the build process completes without syntax errors
- When I access the application, I can navigate to the main page without errors
- When tests run, they execute without encountering build-time syntax errors
- The application routing functionality works as originally designed

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

## Notes

### Issue Context
- **GitHub Issue**: #110
- **Feature**: #5 (Hello Button on Main Page)
- **Branch**: feature/5-add-simple-button-that-says-hello-on-main-page
- **Build Error**: Mismatched tag names in routing component preventing compilation
- **Impact**: Blocks all CI/CD workflows, prevents application from running

### Story Quality Validation
- Story is implementation-agnostic (describes what needs to work, not how to fix it)
- Story focuses on user-observable outcome (application builds and runs)
- Story is atomic (single focused fix)
- Acceptance criteria are testable from build/runtime perspective
- No technical implementation details about specific code changes

### Fix Scope
This is a single-story fix because:
- Only one syntax error needs correction
- The fix is localized to a single component
- No design changes or new functionality required
- Can be completed in under 1 day
- Restores existing functionality without changing behavior
