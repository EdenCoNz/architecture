# Fix for Issue #134: JSX Syntax Error in App Component

## Overview
The frontend application is experiencing a test failure due to a JSX syntax error in the main App component. An opening tag has an incorrect name that doesn't match its closing tag, preventing the application from being properly parsed and tested. Users cannot access the application until this syntax error is corrected.

## Missing Agents
None - frontend-developer agent is available and appropriate for this fix.

## User Stories

### 1. Correct Application Shell Component Tag
The application shell component has a malformed opening tag that prevents the application from loading. As a developer or end user, I need the application to parse correctly so that all features function as expected and tests can verify the application's behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I run the test suite, when the tests execute, then all test files should parse successfully without JSX syntax errors
- Given the application loads, when I navigate to any page, then the application shell should render with proper layout structure
- Given I inspect the component structure, when I view the opening and closing tags, then all component tags should match correctly
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs, when it reaches the test coverage step, then the tests should pass without transform errors

## Notes

### Issue Details
- Issue Type: Bug Fix (Syntax Error)
- Affected File: Application shell component (main layout wrapper)
- Error Type: JSX tag mismatch
- Symptoms: Test execution fails with transform error, application cannot parse
- Root Cause: Opening tag name contains extraneous characters that don't match closing tag

### Story Quality Guidelines
- Generic and implementation-agnostic (no frameworks, libraries, technologies)
- User-focused (describes WHAT users need, not HOW to build it)
- Atomic (1-3 days max, independently deployable)
- Testable (acceptance criteria are user-observable behaviors)
