# Fix: Issue #86 - TypeScript Type Check Failure in App.tsx

## Issue Details
- **Issue**: #86
- **Type**: validation-failure
- **Original Title**: Workflow Failure: Frontend CI/CD - TypeScript Type Check - Run TypeScript type check
- **Feature**: #5 (Hello Button on Main Page)
- **Branch**: feature/5-add-simple-button-that-says-hello-on-main-page

## Issue Summary
TypeScript compilation is failing due to a typo in the App.tsx component where `CssBaseline` is misspelled as `CssBaselsinef` on line 20. This causes two TypeScript errors:
1. Unused import declaration for `CssBaseline` (TS6133)
2. Cannot find name `CssBaselsinef` (TS2552)

## Fix Stories

### 1. Fix Component Name Typo in Application Root
Correct the misspelled component name in the application root to resolve TypeScript type checking errors.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When TypeScript compiler runs, no "Cannot find name 'CssBaselsinef'" error should occur
- When TypeScript compiler runs, no "CssBaseline is declared but its value is never read" error should occur
- When the application renders, the CSS baseline normalization should be applied correctly
- When CI/CD TypeScript type check runs, it should pass without errors

**Dependencies**: none

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: frontend-developer) - Fix typo in component name

## Notes
- This is a simple typo fix: `CssBaselsinef` â†’ `CssBaseline` on line 20 of src/App.tsx
- The component is already properly imported on line 9
- Fix should be straightforward with no side effects
