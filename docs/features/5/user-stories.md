## User Stories

### 1. Design Hello Button Component
Create visual design specifications for a greeting button that will be displayed on the main page. The button should be welcoming, clearly actionable, and consistent with the application's visual language.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Design specifications include button appearance in default, hover, and active states
- Design defines button text, size, color scheme, and positioning on the main page
- Design is documented and accessible for implementation
- Design follows accessibility guidelines for interactive elements

**Agent**: ui-ux-designer
**Dependencies**: none

**Design Context**:
- Update docs/design-brief.md to incorporate design decisions for this feature
- If design-brief.md doesn't exist, create it using docs/design-brief-template.md
- Add a feature-specific section under the "## Features" heading
- Include component specifications, interaction patterns, and all UI states
- Ensure consistency with existing design system

### 2. Display Greeting Button
Implement a button on the main page that users can interact with to receive a greeting. The button should be prominently displayed and clearly indicate its purpose.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When I visit the main page, I should see a button labeled "Hello"
- The button should be visually distinct and easy to locate on the page
- The button should appear interactive (cursor changes on hover)
- The button's appearance matches the approved design specifications

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: Story 1

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: ui-ux-designer) - Create design specifications first

### Phase 2 (Sequential)
- Story #2 (agent: frontend-developer) - Implement button display based on design

### Phase 3 (Sequential)
- Story #3 (agent: frontend-developer) - Add interaction behavior to existing button

---

## Notes

### Feature Simplicity
This is a straightforward feature with minimal complexity. The three stories are kept atomic and focused:
1. Design the visual appearance
2. Display the button
3. Add the interaction behavior

### Story Quality Validation
- All stories are implementation-agnostic (no frameworks or technologies specified)
- All stories focus on user-observable behavior
- Each story delivers independent value
- Acceptance criteria are testable from user perspective
- No technical implementation details included
