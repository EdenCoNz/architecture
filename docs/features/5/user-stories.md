# Feature 5: Architecture System Improvements

## Missing Agents

- **technical-writer**: A specialized agent focused on creating clear, comprehensive, user-focused documentation. While meta-developer can create system documentation as part of building features, a technical-writer would excel at creating standalone guides, tutorials, API documentation, and user-facing materials with better structure, clarity, examples, and accessibility. This would be valuable for creating the comprehensive project documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, AGENT_GUIDE.md, COMMAND_GUIDE.md) with proper onboarding flows, troubleshooting sections, and user-centric organization.
