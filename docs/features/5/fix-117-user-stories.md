# Fix #117: JSX Syntax Error in Application Router Component

## Overview
The application fails to build and deploy due to a JSX syntax error in the main application component. Users cannot access the application because the CI/CD pipeline fails during the lint stage. This fix ensures the application code is syntactically correct and can be built and deployed successfully.

## Root Cause
Feature #5 implementation introduced a typo in the router component tag name, causing a mismatch between opening and closing JSX tags that prevents the application from being parsed correctly.

## User Stories

### 1. Fix Application Build Failure
As a developer, I want the application code to be syntactically correct so that the CI/CD pipeline can successfully build and deploy the application to production.

The application's main routing component has a tag mismatch that prevents the code from being parsed. This needs to be corrected so that users can access the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I run the linting process, when the application code is checked, then no parsing errors should be reported
- Given I run the build process, when the application is compiled, then the build should complete successfully without syntax errors
- Given the CI/CD pipeline executes, when the lint and format check runs, then all checks should pass
- Given I access the application in a browser, when the page loads, then the routing functionality should work correctly

## Implementation Notes

### Context for Frontend Developer
- The error occurs in /home/ed/Dev/architecture/frontend/src/App.tsx at line 23
- The opening tag has incorrect spelling that must match the closing tag at line 58
- The component being used is imported from react-router-dom at line 10
- After fixing, verify that:
  - The component name matches the import statement
  - Opening and closing tags match exactly
  - ESLint validation passes locally before committing
  - The application runs correctly in development mode

### Validation Steps
After implementing the fix:
1. Run local lint check to verify syntax is correct
2. Run local build to ensure compilation succeeds
3. Run application in development mode to verify routing works
4. Verify CI/CD pipeline passes all checks after merge
