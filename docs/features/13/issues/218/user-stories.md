# Issue #218: CI/CD Pipeline Failed - Configuration Validation Test Failure

## Overview
A configuration validation test is failing because empty API URLs are not being properly rejected during frontend configuration validation. This poses a production risk as the application could attempt to connect to invalid or empty API URLs, leading to runtime errors or connection failures. The fix ensures robust configuration validation to prevent deployment of misconfigured applications.

## Missing Agents
None - all required agents are available.

## User Stories

### 1. Empty API URL Rejection
When users or deployment systems provide configuration for the application, empty API URLs must be rejected with clear error messages to prevent runtime connection failures. The configuration validation system should enforce that all API URLs are non-empty strings before the application starts, protecting users from experiencing broken functionality due to misconfiguration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I provide an empty string as the API URL, when the configuration is validated, then I should receive a ConfigValidationError
- Given I provide an empty string as the API URL, when the configuration is validated, then the error message should state "API URL cannot be empty"
- Given the application starts with invalid configuration, when validation runs, then the application should fail to start rather than run with broken API connectivity
- Given the configuration validation test suite runs, when all tests execute, then the empty URL validation test should pass

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

**Technical Context** (for implementation reference):
- Test location: `src/config/index.test.ts:205`
- Function to fix: `validateApiUrl` function
- Expected behavior: Function should throw `ConfigValidationError` when passed an empty string
- Current behavior: Function does not throw any error for empty strings
- Error message should be: "API URL cannot be empty"

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Sequential)
- Story #1 (agent: frontend-developer)

## Notes

### Story Quality Validation
- Generic and implementation-agnostic: The story focuses on validation behavior, not specific validation libraries or frameworks
- User-focused: Describes protection against misconfiguration from user/operator perspective
- Atomic: Single focused fix in one area of the codebase (1-3 hours)
- Testable: Clear acceptance criteria based on observable test results and error handling behavior

### Production Impact
This fix is critical for production safety. Without proper validation, misconfigured deployments could reach production with broken API connectivity, causing complete application failure. The validation ensures fail-fast behavior during deployment rather than runtime failures affecting end users.
