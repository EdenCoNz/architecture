# User Stories for Issue #221: ESLint Configuration File Discovery

**Issue**: CI/CD Pipeline Failed: Build and Test - Run #14
**Feature ID**: 13 - End-to-End Testing Suite
**Branch**: feature/13-end-to-end-testing
**Created**: 2025-10-26

## Problem Summary

The frontend linting step in the CI/CD pipeline is failing because ESLint version 9 cannot find the required configuration file during execution. While the `eslint.config.js` file exists in the project, ESLint's file discovery mechanism is blocked by the current ignore pattern configuration, preventing the linter from locating and using its own configuration file.

This is blocking the build pipeline from completing successfully, which prevents code from being merged and deployments from proceeding.

## Story 13-FIX-221.1: Fix ESLint Configuration File Discovery

**As a** developer
**I want** the linting process to successfully locate and use the ESLint configuration file
**So that** code quality checks can run successfully in the CI/CD pipeline

### Description

The ESLint configuration file discovery mechanism is being blocked by the current ignore pattern configuration. The linting tool needs to be able to discover its configuration file regardless of ignore patterns, ensuring that code quality checks can execute properly during both local development and CI/CD pipeline runs.

When developers run linting checks (either locally via `npm run lint` or automatically in CI/CD), the linter should successfully find and apply the project's ESLint configuration without errors.

### Technical Context

**Root Cause**: The ignore patterns in `eslint.config.js` are configured in a way that prevents ESLint v9 from discovering the configuration file itself. ESLint v9 changed how ignore patterns work in the flat config format, and directory-based patterns may inadvertently block config file discovery.

**Error Message**:
```
ESLint: 9.37.0
ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file.
From ESLint v9.0.0, the default configuration file is now eslint.config.js.
```

**Migration Guide Reference**: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide

**Current Configuration** (`frontend/eslint.config.js` line 12):
```javascript
ignores: ['dist/', 'build/', 'coverage/', 'node_modules/'],
```

**Issue**: These patterns may be too broad or improperly formatted for ESLint v9's flat config system, causing the config file itself to be ignored during discovery.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have code in the frontend directory that needs linting
**When** I run `npm run lint` in the frontend directory
**Then** ESLint should successfully locate the `eslint.config.js` file and begin linting without configuration discovery errors

**Given** the CI/CD pipeline reaches the "Run linting and type checks" step
**When** the pipeline executes `docker compose run --rm frontend npm run lint`
**Then** the linting process should complete without "ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config" errors

**Given** the linting configuration has been updated
**When** I run linting on files that should be ignored (like dist/, node_modules/)
**Then** those files should still be properly excluded from linting checks

### Agent Assignment

**Agent**: frontend-developer

**Rationale**: This is a frontend tooling configuration issue that requires understanding of ESLint v9's flat config format and JavaScript build tool configuration.

## Execution Order

### Sequential Phase 1
- Story 13-FIX-221.1 (Fix ESLint configuration file discovery)

**Rationale**: This is a single isolated issue with one root cause. The fix should resolve the configuration discovery problem and allow the CI/CD pipeline to proceed.

## Validation Checklist

Before marking this issue as resolved, verify:

- [ ] `npm run lint` executes successfully in the frontend directory without config discovery errors
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline "Run linting and type checks" step passes successfully
- [ ] ESLint still properly ignores intended directories (dist/, build/, coverage/, node_modules/)
- [ ] ESLint configuration file can be discovered and loaded by ESLint v9
- [ ] No new linting errors are introduced by the configuration changes
