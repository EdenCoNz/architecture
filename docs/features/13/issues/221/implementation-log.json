    "timestamp": "2025-10-26T05:58:00Z",
    "status": "completed",
    "summary": "Fixed ESLint configuration file discovery in Docker container by adding missing volume mounts",
    "rootCause": "The eslint.config.js file was not being mounted into the Docker container, causing ESLint to be unable to locate its configuration file when running in the CI/CD pipeline",
    "solution": "Added eslint.config.js and .prettierrc to the frontend service volume mounts in docker-compose.yml",
    "filesModified": [
      {
        "path": "/home/ed/Dev/architecture/docker-compose.yml",
        "changes": "Added volume mounts for ./frontend/eslint.config.js:/app/eslint.config.js and ./frontend/.prettierrc:/app/.prettierrc in the frontend service configuration (lines 330-332)",
        "reason": "ESLint and Prettier configuration files need to be accessible inside the Docker container for linting and formatting commands to work properly"

    ],
    "technicalNotes": [
      "The eslint.config.js file uses ESLint v9 flat config format with proper ignore patterns",
      "The issue was NOT with the ignore patterns themselves, but with the file not being accessible in the Docker container at all",
      "Also added .prettierrc mount for consistency, ensuring all code quality tools have their configuration files available in Docker",
