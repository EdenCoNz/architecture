      "The fix was straightforward - simply added the tests/ directory to the existing volume mount pattern used for other frontend source files",
      "Both docker-compose.yml (base) and compose.override.yml (development) were updated to ensure tests are available in all environments",
      "The bind mount ensures test files reflect live changes during development, consistent with the hot module replacement workflow for source code",
      "Pre-existing test failures (9 failed tests out of 224 total) are unrelated to this fix - they are timeout issues and test-specific problems that existed before this implementation",
      "The key metric of success: Test runner successfully found and loaded ./tests/setup.ts without 'Cannot find module' errors",
      "Tests from tests/unit/Home.test.tsx executed successfully, proving that test files in the mounted directory are accessible and functional"
