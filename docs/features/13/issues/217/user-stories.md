# Fix User Stories - Issue #217

**Issue**: CI/CD Pipeline Failed: Build and Test - Run #10
**Feature**: #13 - End-to-End Testing Suite
**Branch**: feature/13-end-to-end-testing
**Created**: 2025-10-26

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is failing because the frontend test runner cannot locate the test configuration file. When tests are executed in the containerized environment, the test setup file at `tests/setup.ts` is not accessible, causing all frontend tests to fail immediately.

## Business Impact

- Developers cannot verify code quality through automated testing in CI/CD
- Pull requests cannot be merged due to failing quality gates
- Test infrastructure is not functioning as designed
- CI/CD pipeline cannot validate that the application works correctly

## Root Cause Summary

The containerized test environment does not include the test files and configuration needed to run tests. The volume mount configuration for the frontend service only mounts source code directories but excludes the test directory, preventing the test runner from accessing test setup files and test cases.

## User Stories

### Story 217.1: Make Test Files Available in Development Container

**As a** developer
**I want** test files to be accessible when running tests in the development container
**So that** I can execute the test suite in the containerized environment

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I am running the frontend service in development mode, when I execute the test command in the container, then the test runner should find and load the test setup file without errors
- Given test files exist in the `tests/` directory, when the container starts, then all test files should be accessible at their expected paths inside the container
- Given I modify a test file locally, when running tests in the container, then the container should reflect the latest changes to test files
- Given the test suite is executed, when tests run, then the test setup configuration should be properly loaded and applied

**Assigned Agent**: devops-engineer

**Technical Context**:
The Vitest configuration references `./tests/setup.ts` as the setup file. The docker-compose.yml currently mounts specific source directories but does not include the `tests/` directory in the volume mounts. The test runner is looking for the setup file at `/app/tests/setup.ts` but cannot find it because the directory is not mounted or copied into the container.

**Implementation Notes**:
- The `tests/` directory exists in the frontend project root
- The `vite.config.ts` file references `./tests/setup.ts` in the setupFiles configuration
- The docker-compose.yml has individual volume mounts for specific files/directories
- Tests should reflect live changes during development (similar to source code)

## Dependencies

- None - This is an isolated configuration fix

## Execution Order

**Sequential**:
1. Story 217.1 - Configure test directory mounting

## Story Summary

- **Total Stories**: 1
- **Assigned Agents**: devops-engineer (1)
- **Estimated Completion**: 0.5 days

## Validation

After implementation, verify:
1. Run `docker compose run --rm frontend npm run test:run` - tests should execute without "Cannot find module" errors
2. Modify a test file and re-run tests - changes should be reflected
3. CI/CD pipeline should pass the frontend testing step
4. All existing tests should execute successfully

## Notes

- This is a configuration-only fix - no code changes required
- The test files already exist in the repository
- The fix ensures the containerized environment matches the local development environment
- This aligns with the development workflow where source files are mounted for live reloading
