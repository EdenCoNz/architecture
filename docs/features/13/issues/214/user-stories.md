# Fix Issue #214: Database Connection Pooling Configuration in Test Environment

## Issue Summary
A test that verifies database connection pooling is disabled during testing failed because the connection pooling timeout (`CONN_MAX_AGE`) was configured to 600 seconds instead of 0. This configuration could cause tests to share database connections, potentially leading to data pollution between tests and false test results. While tests are currently passing, the improper configuration violates test isolation principles.

## Technical Context
- **Test:** `tests/test_data_isolation.py::TestDatabaseConfiguration::test_connection_pooling_disabled_for_tests`
- **Error:** `AssertionError: CONN_MAX_AGE should be 0 in tests for isolation, got 600`
- **Test Results:** 1 failed, 616 passed, 3 skipped
- **Exit Code:** 1

## User Stories

### Story 214.1: Ensure Database Connection Pooling is Disabled in Test Environment
**Agent:** backend-developer

**As a** developer running automated tests
**I want** each test to use a fresh database connection
**So that** tests are properly isolated and don't share database state, ensuring reliable and repeatable test results

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the test suite runs, when the test environment initializes, then the database connection pooling timeout should be 0 seconds
- Given the test `test_connection_pooling_disabled_for_tests` executes, when it checks the `CONN_MAX_AGE` setting, then it should find a value of 0
- Given tests are running, when each test begins, then it should get a fresh database connection rather than reusing pooled connections
- Given all tests complete, when I review the test results, then the `TestDatabaseConfiguration::test_connection_pooling_disabled_for_tests` test should pass

**Technical Notes:**
The test file `tests/test_data_isolation.py` expects `CONN_MAX_AGE` to be 0 in the test environment. The current configuration has it set to 600 seconds. The backend developer should locate the test configuration settings and ensure connection pooling is disabled specifically for the test environment.

**Impact:**
- Ensures proper test isolation by preventing database connection reuse between tests
- Fixes the failing test `test_connection_pooling_disabled_for_tests`
- Maintains test reliability and prevents potential false test results

## Notes

### Root Cause
The database configuration for the test environment currently has connection pooling enabled (`CONN_MAX_AGE = 600`), but tests require fresh connections for proper isolation. This is a configuration issue, not a code logic issue.

### Atomicity Verification
- ✅ Single, focused configuration change
- ✅ Can be completed in less than 1 day
- ✅ Has 4 clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Independently testable (single test validates the fix)
- ✅ Focuses on WHAT needs to be achieved (proper test isolation) not HOW

### Technology Neutrality
The story is written to be implementation-agnostic:
- No specific configuration file format mentioned
- No specific framework settings mentioned
- Agent will determine where and how to configure the setting based on the existing backend implementation
