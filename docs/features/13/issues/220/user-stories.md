# Fix User Stories: Issue #220 - ESLint Configuration Discovery

**Issue Number**: #220
**Issue Title**: CI/CD Pipeline Failed: Build and Test - Run #13
**Feature ID**: 13
**Branch**: feature/13-end-to-end-testing
**Created**: 2025-10-26

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is failing during the linting step because ESLint cannot discover its configuration file. The issue occurs because the `eslint.config.js` file exists but is being excluded from ESLint's file discovery process by its own ignore patterns. This prevents the linting step from completing successfully, blocking the entire deployment pipeline.

## Business Impact

- **Severity**: High
- **Impact**: CI/CD pipeline cannot complete successfully, preventing deployments and potentially blocking merges to production
- **Affected Systems**: Frontend application build and quality assurance process
- **Development Workflow**: Interrupted - developers cannot verify code quality compliance through automated checks

## Technical Context

**Root Cause**: The `eslint.config.js` file contains an ignore pattern (`'*.config.js'`) that excludes all `.config.js` files from linting, including the configuration file itself. This prevents ESLint from discovering and loading its own configuration.

**Error Message**:
```
ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file.

From ESLint v9.0.0, the default configuration file is now eslint.config.js.
If you are using a .eslintrc.* file, please follow the migration guide
to update your configuration file to the new format:

https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide
```

**Failure Location**:
- Job: "Build and Test Complete Stack"
- Step: "Run linting and type checks"
- Command: `docker compose run --rm frontend npm run lint`
- Exit Code: 2 (configuration error)

## User Stories

### Story 1: Fix ESLint Configuration Discovery

**ID**: Fix-220.1
**Title**: Fix ESLint Configuration Discovery
**Assigned To**: frontend-developer
**Story Type**: Bug Fix

#### Description

As a developer running code quality checks, I need ESLint to successfully discover and load its configuration file so that linting can execute and verify code quality standards are met.

The current configuration file contains an ignore pattern that prevents ESLint from discovering its own configuration. The ignore pattern needs to be refined to exclude build artifacts and dependency directories while allowing ESLint to find and load its configuration file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Configuration Discovery**
   - Given the ESLint configuration file exists at `frontend/eslint.config.js`
   - When I run the lint command (`npm run lint`)
   - Then ESLint should successfully discover and load the configuration file
   - And I should not see the error "ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file"

2. **Ignore Patterns Work Correctly**
   - Given the updated ignore patterns in the configuration
   - When I run the lint command
   - Then ESLint should exclude files in `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, and `node_modules/` directories
   - And ESLint should process source files in the `src/` directory
   - And the configuration file itself should be discoverable

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Passes**
   - Given the corrected ESLint configuration
   - When the CI/CD pipeline executes the "Run linting and type checks" step
   - Then the linting command should complete successfully with exit code 0
   - And no configuration discovery errors should appear in the pipeline logs

4. **Local Development Consistency**
   - Given the same configuration used in CI/CD
   - When developers run `npm run lint` locally
   - Then the command should produce the same results as in the CI/CD environment
   - And developers should see immediate feedback on code quality issues

#### Technical Notes

**Current Issue**:
The ignore pattern `'*.config.js'` on line 12 of `frontend/eslint.config.js` is too broad and prevents ESLint from finding its own configuration file.

**Solution Approach**:
- Refine the ignore patterns to be more specific
- Use directory-based ignore patterns (e.g., `'dist/'`, `'build/'`, `'coverage/'`, `'node_modules/'`)
- Remove the blanket `*.config.js` pattern that blocks configuration discovery
- Optionally use more specific patterns like `'vite.config.js'` if needed to exclude specific build tool configs from linting

**Reference**: ESLint v9 flat config format expects `eslint.config.js` to be discoverable in the project root.
