      "The original issue was caused by the ignore pattern '*.config.js' which matched ALL .config.js files, including eslint.config.js itself",
      "ESLint v9 uses the flat config format and expects eslint.config.js to be discoverable in the project root",
      "Directory-based ignore patterns (with trailing slashes) are more precise and prevent accidental exclusion of configuration files",
      "The ignore patterns now only target build artifact directories: dist/, build/, coverage/, and node_modules/",
      "If specific config files need to be excluded from linting in the future, use explicit patterns like 'vite.config.js' instead of wildcards"
