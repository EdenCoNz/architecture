# Feature #13: End-to-End Testing Suite

## Overview
Enable developers and quality assurance teams to verify that the complete application stack (frontend, backend, database integration) works correctly through automated end-to-end tests that validate user workflows, API contracts, visual consistency, and performance requirements in a dedicated testing environment.

## User Stories

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup (Sequential)

#### Story 13.1: Set Up Test Execution Environment
**Agent:** devops-engineer

**As a** developer
**I want** a dedicated test execution environment in the testing/ folder
**So that** I can run end-to-end tests that validate the complete application stack without affecting production or development environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I navigate to the testing/ folder, when I check the directory structure, then I should see organized folders for different test types (e2e, integration, visual, performance)
- Given the test environment is configured, when I run the test suite, then tests should execute in an isolated environment with test-specific configuration
- Given tests are running, when they access application services, then they should connect to test instances (not production or development)
- Given test execution completes, when I review the results, then all test artifacts (logs, screenshots, reports) should be stored in the testing/ folder structure

---

#### Story 13.2: Configure Test Data Isolation
**Agent:** backend-developer

**As a** developer
**I want** test data to be automatically created and cleaned up for each test run
**So that** tests are reliable, repeatable, and don't interfere with each other or other environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a test suite starts, when the test environment initializes, then a fresh test database should be created with a known baseline state
- Given tests are executing, when they create or modify data, then changes should only affect the test database
- Given a test completes, when the next test begins, then each test should have a clean data state
- Given the test suite finishes, when I inspect the production and development databases, then they should be unchanged

---

### Phase 2: User Workflow Testing (Sequential)

#### Story 13.3: Test User Login Flow
**Agent:** frontend-developer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated tests that validate the user login workflow
**So that** I can ensure users can successfully authenticate and access the application

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I run the login flow test, when a user enters valid credentials and submits, then the test should verify the user is redirected to their dashboard
- Given the test uses invalid credentials, when the login is attempted, then the test should verify an error message appears
- Given the login form loads, when I run the test, then it should verify all required form fields are present (email, password, submit button)
- Given a successful login, when the test completes, then it should verify the user session is established

---

#### Story 13.4: Test User Logout Flow
**Agent:** frontend-developer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated tests that validate the logout workflow
**So that** I can ensure users can safely end their sessions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a logged-in user, when the logout action is triggered, then the test should verify the user is redirected to the login page
- Given logout completes, when the test attempts to access protected pages, then access should be denied
- Given a user logs out, when the test checks session state, then the session should be terminated
- Given logout occurs, when the test inspects stored credentials, then sensitive data should be cleared

---

#### Story 13.5: Test Session Persistence
**Agent:** frontend-developer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated tests that validate session persistence
**So that** I can ensure users remain logged in across page refreshes and browser restarts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a user successfully logs in, when the page is refreshed, then the test should verify the user remains authenticated
- Given an active session exists, when the test simulates closing and reopening the browser, then the user should still be logged in
- Given a session has been inactive for a specified period, when the test checks session validity, then the session should expire as expected
- Given a user has "remember me" enabled, when the test verifies long-term persistence, then the session should persist beyond the typical timeout period

---

#### Story 13.6: Test Onboarding Form Completion
**Agent:** frontend-developer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated tests that validate the onboarding form workflow
**So that** I can ensure new users can successfully complete the onboarding process

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the onboarding form loads, when the test fills in all required fields (age, sport, level, training days), then form validation should pass
- Given invalid data is entered, when the test attempts to submit, then appropriate validation errors should be displayed
- Given all fields are valid, when the form is submitted, then the test should verify progression to the next step
- Given the onboarding form is multi-step, when the test navigates between steps, then previously entered data should be preserved

---

#### Story 13.7: Test Assessment Data Submission
**Agent:** backend-developer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated tests that validate assessment data is correctly submitted to the backend
**So that** I can ensure user assessment information is properly stored and processed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given assessment form data is submitted, when the test verifies the backend, then the data should be stored in the database exactly as entered
- Given assessment submission occurs, when the test checks the response, then a success confirmation should be returned
- Given incomplete assessment data is submitted, when the test validates the response, then appropriate validation errors should be returned
- Given assessment data includes special characters or edge cases, when submitted, then the test should verify proper data handling

---

#### Story 13.8: Test Profile Creation from Assessment
**Agent:** backend-developer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated tests that validate user profiles are created from assessment data
**So that** I can ensure the system correctly generates personalized user profiles

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given assessment data is successfully submitted, when the test checks the user profile, then a profile should be created with assessment values
- Given a user completes assessment, when the test verifies profile data, then training days, sport type, level, and equipment should match submitted values
- Given profile creation completes, when the test checks user access, then the user should be able to view their profile
- Given assessment generates recommendations, when the test reviews the profile, then personalized training program suggestions should be present

---

### Phase 3: Quality Validation (Parallel - can run independently)

#### Story 13.9: Visual Regression Testing
**Agent:** frontend-developer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated visual regression tests
**So that** I can detect unintended visual changes in the user interface across releases

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a baseline visual snapshot exists, when the test runs, then it should capture current UI screenshots and compare them to the baseline
- Given visual differences are detected, when the test completes, then it should generate a visual diff report highlighting the changes
- Given the UI matches the baseline, when the test runs, then it should pass without flagging any differences
- Given visual tests run, when I review the results, then I should see screenshots of all critical user interface states (login, dashboard, onboarding, assessment)

---

#### Story 13.10: API Endpoint Validation
**Agent:** backend-developer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated tests that validate all API endpoints
**So that** I can ensure the backend API adheres to its contract and returns correct responses

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given API endpoints are called with valid requests, when the test validates responses, then status codes, response structure, and data types should match the API specification
- Given invalid requests are sent to endpoints, when the test checks responses, then appropriate error codes and messages should be returned
- Given authentication is required, when the test accesses protected endpoints without credentials, then access should be denied
- Given API tests execute, when I review results, then all endpoints should be tested (health, auth, assessment, user profile, config)

---

#### Story 13.11: Performance Threshold Validation
**Agent:** devops-engineer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** automated performance tests that validate response times
**So that** I can ensure the application meets performance requirements under expected load

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given performance tests run, when critical user workflows execute, then response times should be below defined thresholds (e.g., page load < 2s, API response < 500ms)
- Given multiple concurrent users are simulated, when the test measures throughput, then the application should handle the expected concurrent load without degradation
- Given performance tests complete, when I review the results, then I should see response time metrics for all critical operations (login, page load, API calls, form submissions)
- Given performance degrades below thresholds, when the test runs, then it should fail and report which operations are too slow

---

### Phase 4: Test Automation Integration (Sequential)

#### Story 13.12: Automated Test Execution on Code Changes
**Agent:** devops-engineer

**As a** developer
**I want** end-to-end tests to run automatically when code is pushed
**So that** I can catch integration issues before they reach production

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given code is pushed to the repository, when the CI/CD pipeline runs, then the end-to-end test suite should execute automatically
- Given tests are running in CI/CD, when I check the pipeline status, then I should see test execution progress in real-time
- Given all tests pass, when the pipeline completes, then the build should be marked as successful
- Given any test fails, when the pipeline runs, then the build should be marked as failed and deployments should be blocked

---

#### Story 13.13: Test Failure Notifications
**Agent:** devops-engineer

**As a** developer
**I want** notifications when end-to-end tests fail
**So that** I can quickly respond to integration issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a test fails in CI/CD, when the failure is detected, then the team should receive a notification (via GitHub, email, or messaging platform)
- Given a notification is sent, when I review it, then it should include which tests failed, error messages, and a link to full test results
- Given tests fail on a pull request, when I view the PR, then I should see test failure details inline with the code review
- Given test failures occur, when I access the notification, then I should be able to view test logs, screenshots, and error traces

---

### Phase 5: Test Utilities (Parallel - support infrastructure)

#### Story 13.14: Test Data Generation
**Agent:** backend-developer

**As a** developer
**I want** utilities to generate realistic test data
**So that** tests can use representative data without manual creation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need test users, when I call the data generation utility, then it should create user accounts with realistic profile data
- Given I need test assessments, when I use the utility, then it should generate valid assessment submissions with varied attributes (different sports, levels, training days)
- Given I need edge case data, when I use the generator, then it should support creating boundary values (minimum/maximum ages, all equipment combinations)
- Given test data is generated, when tests use it, then the data should be valid and representative of real user input

---

#### Story 13.15: Test Execution Reporting
**Agent:** devops-engineer

**As a** quality assurance tester
**I want** comprehensive test execution reports
**So that** I can analyze test results, trends, and coverage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given tests complete, when I access the test report, then I should see pass/fail status for each test with execution time
- Given test failures occur, when I review the report, then I should see error messages, stack traces, and screenshots captured at the point of failure
- Given multiple test runs exist, when I view the report, then I should see historical trends (pass rate over time, flaky tests, performance trends)
- Given the report is generated, when I share it, then it should be in a standard format (HTML, JSON, or PDF) that can be viewed without specialized tools

## Notes

### Design Considerations
No UI/UX designer involvement needed - this is a testing infrastructure feature that doesn't involve user-facing design elements.

### Technology Neutrality
All stories are written to be implementation-agnostic:
- No specific testing frameworks mentioned (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, etc.)
- No specific performance tools mentioned (k6, JMeter, Lighthouse, etc.)
- No specific visual regression tools mentioned (Percy, Chromatic, BackstopJS, etc.)
- Agents will select appropriate tools based on the existing tech stack

### Test Organization
Tests will be organized in the /testing folder as requested:
```
testing/
├── e2e/           # End-to-end user workflow tests
├── integration/   # API integration tests
├── visual/        # Visual regression tests
├── performance/   # Performance and load tests
├── fixtures/      # Test data and utilities
└── reports/       # Test execution reports
```

### Atomicity Verification
Each story:
- ✅ Delivers ONE complete testing capability
- ✅ Can be completed in 1-3 days
- ✅ Has 3-4 acceptance criteria
- ✅ Is independently testable and deployable
- ✅ Focuses on WHAT needs to be tested, not HOW
