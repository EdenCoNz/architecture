# Fix #191: TypeScript Compilation Errors in Frontend

## Overview
The frontend application fails to build due to TypeScript compilation errors that prevent deployment. Users cannot access the API test page because the application does not compile. These errors stem from incorrect import syntax and incompatible syntax constructs that violate TypeScript compiler settings.

## Technical Context (For Developer Reference)

The following technical details extracted from CI/CD logs provide implementation guidance:

**Error 1** (src/pages/ApiTest/ApiTest.tsx:17:43):
```
error TS1484: 'ApiTestResponse' is a type and must be imported using a type-only import when 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is enabled.
```

**Error 2** (src/services/api.ts:28:5):
```
error TS1294: This syntax is not allowed when 'erasableSyntaxOnly' is enabled.
```

**Error 3** (src/services/api.ts:29:5):
```
error TS1294: This syntax is not allowed when 'erasableSyntaxOnly' is enabled.
```

## User Stories

### Story-191.1: Fix Type Import Syntax in API Test Component
The API test page component currently uses incorrect import syntax for type definitions, preventing the application from compiling. Users need the application to build successfully so they can test backend connectivity.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the frontend application is built, when TypeScript compilation runs, then the ApiTest component should compile without type import errors
- Given I am a developer reviewing the code, when I examine the ApiTest component imports, then type-only imports should be clearly distinguished from value imports
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs, when the TypeScript type check job executes, then it should pass without TS1484 errors

**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Dependencies**: none

### Story-191.2: Fix Syntax Compatibility in API Service
The API service configuration uses syntax constructs that are incompatible with the current TypeScript compiler settings, blocking the entire frontend build. Users cannot access any part of the application because the build process fails.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the frontend application is built, when TypeScript compilation runs, then the API service module should compile without syntax compatibility errors
- Given I am a developer reviewing the code, when I examine the API service file, then all syntax should be compatible with enabled TypeScript compiler options
- Given the CI/CD pipeline runs, when the TypeScript type check job executes, then it should pass without TS1294 errors

## Story Quality Validation

### Generic & Implementation-Agnostic
- ✅ Stories describe compilation and build failures from a user perspective
- ✅ Stories focus on WHAT needs to work (successful builds) not HOW to implement
- ✅ Technical details provided separately for developer reference

### User-Focused
- ✅ Stories explain the user impact (cannot access application, cannot test API)
- ✅ Stories use domain language (compilation, build, type checking)

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ All criteria describe observable outcomes (compilation success, no errors)
- ✅ Criteria include both build-time and runtime perspectives
- ✅ Technical error codes referenced for traceability

### Atomic
- ✅ Each story addresses a specific compilation error category
- ✅ Stories can be completed independently
- ✅ Each story has 3 focused acceptance criteria
