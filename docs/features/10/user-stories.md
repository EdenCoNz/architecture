## User Stories

### Story-10.1: Backend Test Endpoint
**Agent:** backend-developer
**Execution Phase:** 1 (Sequential)
**Dependencies:** None

**As a** frontend developer
**I want** a backend endpoint that returns test data
**So that** I can verify connectivity between frontend and backend applications

**Description:**
The system needs to provide a dedicated endpoint for testing API connectivity. When called, this endpoint should return a simple, predictable response that confirms the backend is accessible and responding correctly. This endpoint should be publicly accessible without authentication to simplify initial integration testing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Given** the backend application is running, **when** I make a request to the test endpoint, **then** I should receive an HTTP 200 success response
2. **Given** I call the test endpoint, **when** the response is received, **then** it should include a success message indicating the backend is operational
3. **Given** I call the test endpoint, **when** the response is received, **then** it should include a timestamp showing when the response was generated
4. **Given** I call the test endpoint from any origin, **when** the request is made, **then** CORS headers should allow the frontend application to receive the response

### Story-10.2: Test Page with User Interface
**Agent:** frontend-developer
**Execution Phase:** 2 (Sequential - depends on Story-10.1)
**Dependencies:** Story-10.1

**As a** user
**I want** a dedicated test page in the application
**So that** I can manually trigger API connectivity tests

**Description:**
Create a new page in the frontend application specifically for testing backend connectivity. This page should be easily accessible from the main navigation and provide a clear, simple interface for triggering API calls. The page should be labeled clearly as a test or diagnostic page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Given** I access the application, **when** I navigate to the test page route, **then** I should see a page titled "API Connection Test" or similar
2. **Given** I am on the test page, **when** the page loads, **then** I should see a button labeled "Test Backend Connection" or similar
3. **Given** I am on the test page, **when** the page loads, **then** I should see a clearly designated area where test results will be displayed
4. **Given** I am viewing the application on mobile or desktop, **when** I access the test page, **then** the layout should be responsive and usable

### Story-10.3: API Call Functionality
**Agent:** frontend-developer
**Execution Phase:** 3 (Sequential - depends on Story-10.2)
**Dependencies:** Story-10.2

**As a** user
**I want** to trigger an API call to the backend by clicking a button
**So that** I can test if the frontend can communicate with the backend

**Description:**
Implement the functionality to make an actual HTTP request from the frontend to the backend test endpoint when the user clicks the test button. The system should handle the network request, manage loading states, and prepare to receive the response. Error handling should be included to manage network failures or timeouts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Given** I am on the test page, **when** I click the "Test Backend Connection" button, **then** an HTTP request should be sent to the backend test endpoint
2. **Given** I click the test button, **when** the request is in progress, **then** I should see a loading indicator (spinner, text, or disabled button)
3. **Given** the backend is unreachable, **when** I click the test button, **then** I should see an error message indicating the connection failed
4. **Given** I receive a response from the backend, **when** the request completes, **then** the loading indicator should disappear

### Story-10.4: Display API Response
**Agent:** frontend-developer
**Execution Phase:** 4 (Sequential - depends on Story-10.3)
**Dependencies:** Story-10.3

**As a** user
**I want** to see the backend's response displayed on the test page
**So that** I can confirm that data is successfully traveling between frontend and backend

**Description:**
Display the response received from the backend test endpoint in a user-friendly format. The display should clearly show that the connection was successful and present the data returned by the backend. Users should be able to easily read and understand the response, confirming that bidirectional communication is working.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Given** I successfully call the backend test endpoint, **when** the response is received, **then** I should see a success message displayed on the page
2. **Given** the backend returns test data, **when** the response is displayed, **then** I should see the message content from the backend response
3. **Given** the backend returns a timestamp, **when** the response is displayed, **then** I should see the timestamp in a readable format
4. **Given** I click the test button multiple times, **when** each response is received, **then** I should see the updated response data (including new timestamp) each time

## Story Summary

**Total Stories:** 4
**Estimated Complexity:** Low-Medium
**Primary Agents:** backend-developer (1 story), frontend-developer (3 stories)

### Story Distribution by Agent:
- **backend-developer:** 1 story (Story-10.1)
- **frontend-developer:** 3 stories (Story-10.2, Story-10.3, Story-10.4)

### Execution Flow:
The implementation follows a sequential waterfall approach:
1. Backend must create the test endpoint first (Phase 1)
2. Frontend creates the UI page structure (Phase 2)
3. Frontend implements the API calling mechanism (Phase 3)
4. Frontend implements response display functionality (Phase 4)

This ensures each component is built in the correct order, with the backend endpoint ready before frontend integration begins, and each frontend layer building upon the previous one.

## Notes

### Technical Considerations (For Implementing Agents):
- Backend endpoint should be simple and stateless
- Frontend should use existing HTTP client configuration
- Consider using environment variables for backend URL configuration
- CORS configuration must allow frontend origin
- Error handling should cover network errors, timeouts, and unexpected responses

### Testing Considerations:
- Backend endpoint should be testable independently
- Frontend should be testable with mocked API responses
- Integration test should verify end-to-end connectivity
- Test page should be accessible in all deployment environments (dev, staging, production)

### User Experience:
- Button clicks should provide immediate visual feedback
- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable
- Success states should clearly indicate what worked
- The test page can be used for troubleshooting deployment issues
