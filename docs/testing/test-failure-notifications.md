# Test Failure Notifications

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test failure notification system implemented for end-to-end, integration, and performance tests. The system ensures that developers are promptly notified of test failures with detailed diagnostic information to enable rapid issue resolution.

## Notification Channels

### 1. GitHub Native Notifications (Default - Always Enabled)

#### GitHub Issues (Main Branch Failures)

**When**: Tests fail on the `main` branch
**How**: Automated via `detect-workflow-failures.yml` workflow

**What's Included**:
- Workflow name and run number
- Branch and commit SHA
- List of failed jobs and steps
- Direct links to workflow run and logs
- Automatic issue labeling with `workflow-failure`
- Auto-closure when tests pass again

**Example Issue Format**:
```markdown
# Workflow Failure Report

## Workflow Information
- **Workflow Name**: End-to-End Tests
- **Run ID**: 1234567890
- **Branch**: main
- **Commit**: abc1234
- **Run URL**: [View on GitHub](...)

## Summary
This workflow run failed with 2 job/step failure(s).

## Failed Jobs and Steps

### 1. E2E Test Execution - Run E2E tests
**Job URL**: https://github.com/.../jobs/...
```

#### Pull Request Comments (PR Branch Failures)

**When**: Tests fail on pull request branches
**How**: Automated inline comments on PRs

**What's Included**:
- Test execution summary with pass/fail metrics
- Detailed list of failed tests (up to 10)
- Error messages and file locations
- Links to all test artifacts (screenshots, videos, traces, logs)
- Step-by-step debugging instructions
- Links to relevant documentation

**Example PR Comment**:
```markdown
## ‚ùå E2E Test Results

**Suite:** All E2E tests
**Overall Status:** ‚ùå FAILED
**Branch:** `feature/123`
**Commit:** `abc1234`

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total Tests | 50 | 100% |
| ‚úÖ Passed | 48 | 96.0% |
| ‚ùå Failed | 2 | 4.0% |
| ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | 0 | 0.0% |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Test Failures Detected

   ```

3. **Add Email Notification Step to Workflow**

   Add this step to `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` after test execution:

   ```yaml
   - name: Send email notification on failure
     if: failure() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
     uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
     with:
       server_address: smtp.sendgrid.net

       secure: true
       username: apikey
       password: ${{ secrets.SENDGRID_API_KEY }}
       subject: "‚ùå E2E Tests Failed - ${{ github.repository }}"
       to: ${{ secrets.NOTIFICATION_EMAIL }}
       from: "GitHub Actions <noreply@github.com>"
       body: |

### Accessing Test Artifacts

#### From GitHub UI

1. Navigate to Actions tab in repository
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Scroll to "Artifacts" section at bottom
4. Download artifact ZIP files:
   - `e2e-test-results-<sha>` - HTML reports and JSON data
   - `e2e-test-failures-<sha>` - Screenshots, videos, traces
   - `service-logs-<sha>` - Service logs (if tests failed)

#### From Notification Links

All PR comments and GitHub Summaries include direct links to:
- Workflow run page
- Workflow logs
- Individual job logs

#### Viewing Playwright Traces

1. Download trace files from artifacts
2. Visit https://trace.playwright.dev/
3. Drag and drop trace file to viewer
4. Explore step-by-step test execution with:
   - DOM snapshots
   - Network requests
   - Console logs
   - Screenshots at each step
   - Action timings

## Notification Filtering

### Conditional Notifications

You can configure notifications to only trigger under specific conditions:

#### Only on Main Branch
```yaml
if: failure() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

#### Only on PR Branches
```yaml
if: failure() && github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

#### Only on Scheduled Runs
```yaml
if: failure() && github.event_name == 'schedule'
```

#### Only for Specific Test Suites
```yaml
if: failure() && steps.test_suite.outputs.suite == 'critical'
```

#### Based on Failure Threshold
```yaml
if: failure() && steps.test_summary.outputs.failed >= 5
```

## Troubleshooting Notifications

### Notifications Not Received

**GitHub Issues/PR Comments:**
- Verify workflow has `issues: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions
- Check workflow run completed successfully (notifications run even if tests fail)
- Verify `detect-workflow-failures.yml` is enabled

**Email Notifications:**
- Verify email secrets are configured correctly
- Check spam/junk folders
- Review workflow logs for email sending errors
- Test SMTP credentials independently

**Slack Notifications:**
- Verify webhook URL is correct and active
- Check Slack app has required permissions
- Review workflow logs for HTTP errors
- Test webhook with curl command

### Missing Artifact Links

- Verify artifact upload steps ran successfully
- Check artifact retention period hasn't expired (default 30 days for test results)
- Ensure workflow has `actions: read` permission for artifact access

### Incomplete Failure Details

- Verify test framework is generating JSON reports
- Check `jq` parsing commands in workflow
- Review test execution logs for output format issues
- Ensure test results are written to expected file paths

## Best Practices

1. **Use Multiple Channels**: Combine GitHub native notifications with one external channel (email or Slack)

2. **Filter Appropriately**: Only send critical alerts to email/Slack; use PR comments for all test runs

3. **Test Notifications**: Trigger a deliberate test failure to verify notification system works

4. **Secure Secrets**: Use GitHub Secrets for all API keys and tokens; never commit them to code

5. **Monitor Notification Volume**: If failures are frequent, consider fixing root causes rather than silencing alerts

6. **Include Context**: Ensure notifications provide enough information to diagnose issues without opening GitHub

7. **Maintain Artifacts**: Keep test artifacts (screenshots, logs) for at least 30 days for post-mortem analysis

8. **Document Custom Notifications**: If adding custom notification logic, document in this file

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook URLs**: Treat webhook URLs as secrets; rotate them periodically
2. **API Keys**: Use restricted API keys with minimum required permissions
3. **Sensitive Data**: Avoid including passwords, tokens, or PII in notifications
4. **Public Repositories**: Be cautious with artifact visibility in public repos
5. **Rate Limits**: Respect notification service rate limits to avoid blocking

## Maintenance

This notification system should be reviewed quarterly to ensure:
- All notification channels are functioning
- Secrets/credentials are rotated
- Notification content remains relevant
- New test types are covered
