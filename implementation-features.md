Feature 1: Logging Guidelines & Standards

  Description: Create comprehensive logging guidelines that define what to log, what to omit, and how to structure implementation logs for optimal
  value-to-noise ratio.

  Scope:
  - Create docs/logging-guidelines.md with clear rules for agents
  - Define 3-tier logging levels: Essential, Contextual, Optional
  - Provide examples of good vs. bad logging practices
  - Create decision matrix: "Should I log this action?"
  - Document outcome-focused vs process-focused logging

  Deliverables:
  - Logging guidelines document
  - Examples for each agent type
  - Quick reference checklist

  Dependencies: None

  Estimated Impact: Foundation for all other improvements

  Feature 2: Implement Command Logging Updates

  Description: Update the /implement command to enforce new logging standards and reduce verbosity in implementation logs by 50-65%.

  Scope:
  - Update .claude/commands/implement.md logging requirements
  - Change from "log every action" to "log outcomes and decisions"
  - Remove requirements to log routine Read/Edit/Bash operations
  - Add reference to logging guidelines
  - Update log schema to support summary + detail separation
  - Modify acceptance criteria validation for logging

  Deliverables:
  - Updated implement.md command
  - Updated feature-log-schema.json (if needed)
  - Migration notes for existing logs

  Dependencies: Feature 1 (guidelines must exist first)

  Estimated Impact: Immediate 50-65% reduction in new logs

  ---
  Feature 3: Hierarchical Implementation Log Storage

  Description: Implement a hierarchical storage structure where main logs contain high-level summaries and detailed audit trails are stored in separate
  per-story files.

  Scope:
  - Create new directory structure: docs/features/{id}/stories/
  - Split implementation logs into:
    - Main log: High-level summary (50-100 lines per story)
    - Detail files: Full audit trail per story
  - Update implement command to write to both locations
  - Create utility to migrate existing logs to new structure
  - Update all agents to write hierarchical logs

  Deliverables:
  - New storage structure
  - Updated implement.md to use hierarchical approach
  - Migration script for existing features
  - Updated agent prompts

  Dependencies: Feature 2 (implement command must be updated first)

  Estimated Impact: Main logs stay <1,000 lines even for complex features

  ---
  Feature 4: Auto-Summarization on Write

  Description: Enable agents to automatically generate both summary and detailed logs during implementation, eliminating the need for manual /summarise
  runs.

  Scope:
  - Agents write two artifacts simultaneously:
    - Summary for main log (outcome-focused)
    - Detail for story-specific file (when needed)
  - Update agent prompts with summarization instructions
  - Define summary format and required elements
  - Remove dependency on manual /summarise command
  - Update feature-log.json to track auto-summarization

  Deliverables:
  - Updated agent prompts for all agent types
  - Summary format specification
  - Deprecation plan for manual /summarise

  Dependencies: Feature 3 (hierarchical storage must exist)

  Estimated Impact: Real-time summaries, no lag time, always current

  ---
  Feature 5: Agent-Specific Logging Profiles

  Description: Differentiate logging requirements by agent type, with technical agents (backend/frontend) logging more detail than coordination agents
  (ui-ux-designer).

  Scope:
  - Create logging profiles for each agent type:
    - backend-developer: Full technical detail
    - frontend-developer: Full technical detail
    - ui-ux-designer: High-level outcomes only
    - devops-engineer: Medium detail, focus on config
    - product-owner: Minimal logging (user stories only)
  - Update agent prompts with profile-specific requirements
  - Document rationale for each profile level

  Deliverables:
  - Logging profile definitions
  - Updated agent prompts
  - Profile selection matrix

  Dependencies: Features 1, 2 (guidelines and implement command must be updated)

  Estimated Impact: Further 10-15% reduction, better agent performance

  ---
  Feature 6: Validation & Metrics System

  Description: Create tooling to validate log quality, measure verbosity, and ensure guidelines are being followed.

  Scope:
  - Create validation script to check log format/structure
  - Build metrics dashboard:
    - Lines per story (before/after comparison)
    - Value density score (decisions/issues vs total lines)
    - Compliance with guidelines
  - Add pre-commit validation for log quality
  - Create reporting: "Feature X has excessive verbosity"
  - Automated suggestions for improvement

  Deliverables:
  - Validation script (scripts/validate-logs.py)
  - Metrics dashboard or report generator
  - Pre-commit hook for log validation
  - Monthly quality reports

  Dependencies: Features 1, 2, 3 (standards must be established)

  Estimated Impact: Maintains quality over time, prevents regression

  ---
  Feature 7: Legacy Log Compression (Optional)

  Description: Compress or migrate existing verbose logs to new format without losing information.

  Scope:
  - Analyze existing logs (Features 1-16)
  - Extract essential information only
  - Create compressed versions following new guidelines
  - Preserve full detail in archive directory
  - Update feature-log.json pointers
  - Document compression methodology

  Deliverables:
  - Compression script
  - Compressed logs for Features 1-16
  - Archive of original logs
  - Compression report

  Dependencies: Features 1, 2, 3 (new format must be defined)

  Estimated Impact: Reduces existing context burden by 50%+

  Note: This is optional - could leave old logs as-is and only apply new standards to future features.
