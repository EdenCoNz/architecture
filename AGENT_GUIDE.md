# Agent Guide

## What is an Agent?

An **agent** is a specialized AI persona optimized for specific types of development work. Each agent has:

- **Focused expertise** in a particular domain (backend development, UI/UX design, DevOps, etc.)
- **Defined responsibilities** that clearly separate concerns
- **Established workflows** for approaching tasks systematically
- **Best practices** specific to their domain
- **Clear boundaries** to prevent overlap with other agents

Agents are defined in `.claude/agents/*.md` files using YAML frontmatter and structured markdown.

## When to Create a New Agent

Create a new specialized agent when:

1. **Distinct Domain Expertise Required**: The work requires specialized knowledge that doesn't fit existing agents
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The responsibilities are distinct from existing agents
3. **Recurring Pattern**: The type of work will be needed repeatedly across features
4. **Different Workflow**: The work requires a fundamentally different approach than existing agents
5. **Quality Benefits**: Specialization will improve output quality and consistency

**Don't create a new agent when:**
- The work is a one-time task
- An existing agent can handle it with minor workflow adjustments
- The domain is too narrow or overlaps heavily with existing agents
- The agent would rarely be used

## Best Practices for Agent Design

### 1. Clear, Focused Purpose

**Good:**
> You are an elite backend developer with extensive experience building production-grade server-side systems. Your expertise spans multiple programming languages, frameworks, databases, and architectural patterns.

**Bad:**
> You are a developer who can do backend, frontend, and some DevOps work.

**Why:** Agents should have deep expertise in a narrow domain rather than shallow expertise across multiple domains.

### 2. Explicit Scope Boundaries

**Always include scope boundaries to prevent overlap:**

```markdown
**Important**: You focus exclusively on frontend application code and architecture.
All DevOps activities (Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions
workflows, deployment automation) are handled by the devops-engineer agent and
should NOT be part of your responsibilities.
```

This prevents:
- Role confusion between agents
- Work being assigned to wrong agents
- Duplicate capabilities across agents

### 3. Comprehensive but Organized Expertise

**Structure expertise into logical categories:**

```markdown
## Core Expertise

### Languages & Frameworks
- Python (Django/DRF)
- Node.js (Express, NestJS)

### Database Systems
- SQL databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- NoSQL databases: MongoDB, Redis

### API Development
- RESTful API design
- GraphQL implementation
```

**Why:** Organized expertise is scannable and helps users understand agent capabilities quickly.

### 4. Actionable Workflows

**Bad workflow step:**
> 1. Understand the requirements

**Good workflow step:**
> 1. **Review Provided Context**
>    - Context files are pre-loaded by the calling command
>    - Review the provided context to understand project-specific requirements
>    - Understand existing code patterns, conventions, and standards
>    - Identify relevant frameworks and best practices

**Why:** Good workflows provide specific, actionable guidance with decision points and considerations.

### 5. Concrete Best Practices

**Bad:**
> Write good code

**Good:**
> ### Code Quality
> - Write clean, idiomatic code following language-specific conventions
> - Include error handling for edge cases and failure scenarios
> - Add logging at appropriate levels (debug, info, warn, error)
> - Follow SOLID principles for maintainability

**Why:** Specific, actionable best practices guide behavior and improve output quality.

### 6. Clear Response Formats

Define how the agent should structure their output:

```markdown
## Report / Response

### When Providing Solutions
- Present working code with complete implementations
- Explain trade-offs between different approaches
- Include error handling for edge cases
- Provide testing strategies
- Document key decisions
```

### 7. Self-Verification Checklists

Include domain-specific verification points:

```markdown
### Self-Verification Checklist
Before finalizing recommendations, verify:
- Does this support TDD workflows?
- Is this testable and maintainable?
- Does this meet performance requirements?
- Is this accessible by default?
- Have I explained the trade-offs?
```

## Complete Examples

## Troubleshooting Common Agent Creation Issues

### Issue 1: Agent Scope Too Broad

**Problem:** Agent tries to do too many different types of work

**Example:**
```markdown
## Purpose
You are a full-stack developer who handles backend, frontend, database, DevOps,
and testing work.
```

**Solution:** Split into specialized agents

```markdown
## Purpose
You are an elite backend developer with extensive experience building
production-grade server-side systems. Your expertise spans API development,
database design, and backend architecture.

**Important**: You focus exclusively on application code and logic. All DevOps
activities are handled by the devops-engineer agent.
```

**Why:** Specialized agents produce higher quality output than generalists.

---

### Issue 2: Vague Workflows

**Problem:** Workflow steps are too abstract

**Bad:**
```markdown
1. Understand requirements
2. Implement solution
3. Test
```

**Good:**
```markdown
1. **Review Provided Context**
   - Context files are pre-loaded by the calling command
   - Review the provided context to understand project-specific requirements
   - Understand existing code patterns and conventions
   - Identify relevant frameworks and best practices

2. **Design Before Implementation**
   - Consider architecture patterns appropriate for the problem
   - Plan data models and API contracts
   - Design error handling strategies
   - Think through failure scenarios

3. **Implement with Quality (TDD Approach)**
   - Write tests first following TDD principles
   - Implement code to make tests pass
   - Refactor while keeping tests green
   - Include error handling, logging, validation
```

**Why:** Specific, actionable workflows guide better decision-making.

---

### Issue 3: Missing Boundaries

**Problem:** No clear separation from other agents

**Solution:** Always include explicit boundaries:

```markdown
**Important**: You focus exclusively on frontend application code and architecture.
All DevOps activities (Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions
workflows, deployment automation, infrastructure as code) are handled by the
devops-engineer agent and should NOT be part of your responsibilities.
```

**Why:** Clear boundaries prevent overlap and ensure work goes to the right agent.

---

### Issue 4: Generic Best Practices

**Problem:** Best practices are too generic to be useful

**Bad:**
```markdown
### Best Practices
- Write good code
- Test your work
- Document changes
```

**Good:**
```markdown
### Code Quality
- Write clean, idiomatic code following language-specific best practices
- Include error handling for edge cases and failure scenarios
- Add logging at appropriate levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Follow SOLID principles for maintainability

### Testing & TDD
- **Follow Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Ensure high test coverage for business-critical code
```

**Why:** Specific practices provide actionable guidance.

---

### Issue 5: Inconsistent Structure

**Problem:** Agent file doesn't follow established patterns

**Solution:** Use the template structure consistently:
1. YAML frontmatter (name, description, model)
2. Agent Name (H1)
3. Purpose section
4. Core Expertise section
5. Best Practices section
6. Workflow section
7. Report / Response section

**Why:** Consistency makes agents easier to understand and maintain.

---

### Issue 6: Missing Self-Verification

**Problem:** No checklist for agent to verify their work

**Solution:** Always include a self-verification checklist:

```markdown
### Self-Verification Checklist
Before finalizing work, verify:
- ✅ Tests written before implementation (TDD)
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities checked
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ✅ Performance considerations addressed
- ✅ Code is maintainable and documented
- ✅ Production readiness verified
```

**Why:** Self-verification improves output quality and catches issues early.

## Testing and Validation

### Before Deploying a New Agent

3. **Verify Scope Boundaries**
   - [ ] Agent has clear, focused purpose
   - [ ] Boundaries clearly state what's excluded
   - [ ] No overlap with existing agents
   - [ ] References to other agents for excluded work

4. **Test with Sample User Story**
   - Create a test user story appropriate for the agent
   - Assign the story to the new agent
   - Verify the agent produces expected output
   - Check that the agent stays within scope

5. **Review Response Quality**
   - [ ] Agent provides actionable, specific guidance
   - [ ] Trade-offs are explained clearly
   - [ ] Examples are concrete and relevant

- **Story Templates**: `.claude/helpers/story-templates.md` - See how stories are assigned to agents
- **Product Owner Agent**: `.claude/agents/product-owner.md` - Understand agent assignment logic

## Getting Help

If you're unsure whether to create a new agent or extend an existing one:

1. **Review existing agents** to understand current coverage
2. **Check product-owner agent** to see agent assignment patterns
3. **Consider the frequency** of the work type
4. **Evaluate specialization benefits** vs. added complexity
5. **Discuss in planning** if creating a new agent for a feature

Remember: **Agents should be specialized, focused, and clearly bounded**. When in doubt, start with an existing agent and split later if needed.
