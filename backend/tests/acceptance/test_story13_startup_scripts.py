Acceptance tests for User Story #13: Create Development Startup Scripts.

These tests verify that all acceptance criteria are met:
1. Development script starts server with hot reload enabled
2. Code changes in development mode trigger server restart
3. Production script starts server in optimized production mode
4. Available scripts have clear documentation

Note: These are acceptance tests that verify the scripts exist and are
properly configured. Full end-to-end testing of script execution is better
done in a real environment due to subprocess complexity.
