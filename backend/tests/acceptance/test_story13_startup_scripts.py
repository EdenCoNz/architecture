"""
Acceptance tests for User Story #13: Create Development Startup Scripts.

These tests verify that all acceptance criteria are met by verifying the
Docker Compose-based workflow that replaced the legacy shell scripts.

Note: Feature #15 transitioned from standalone shell scripts (dev.sh, prod.sh,
test.sh, seed.sh) to Docker Compose orchestration. These tests verify the
Docker workflow provides equivalent functionality to the original scripts.

Tests verify:
1. Development server starts with hot reload through Docker Compose
2. Code changes in development mode trigger server restart
3. Production deployment uses optimized Docker configuration
4. Clear documentation of Docker workflow replaces shell script docs
