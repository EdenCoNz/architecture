"""
Unit tests package.

This package contains unit tests for individual components, functions,
and classes in isolation. Unit tests should be fast and not depend on
external resources like databases or APIs.

Structure:
    unit/
        apps/           - Unit tests for app-specific code
        common/         - Unit tests for common utilities
        core/           - Unit tests for core services and repositories

Best Practices:
    - Mock external dependencies
    - Test one component at a time
    - Use descriptive test names
    - Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
    - Aim for high code coverage (>80%)
