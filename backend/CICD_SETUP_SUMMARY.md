```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **CI/CD workflow file created with build, lint, and test jobs**
- Complete workflow with 8 comprehensive jobs
- Organized in dependency graph for optimal execution

✅ **Pipeline runs automatically on pull requests and main branch pushes**
- Configured for PRs to `main` and `bau/**` branches
- Configured for pushes to `main` branch
- Manual trigger available via workflow_dispatch

✅ **All checks must pass before pull request can be merged**
- Required status checks: lint, format, type-check, test, build
- Jobs properly sequenced with dependencies
- Branch protection configuration documented

✅ **Workflow uses dependency caching for faster execution**
- Poetry installation cache (~/.local)
- Virtual environment cache (backend/.venv)
- Cache invalidation on dependency changes
- Speed improvement: ~3-5 minutes per run

## Pipeline Jobs Summary

| Job | Runtime | Purpose | Blocks Merge |
|-----|---------|---------|--------------|
| Lint Check | ~2-3 min | Code quality (Ruff) | ✅ Yes |
| Format Check | ~2-3 min | Code formatting (Black) | ✅ Yes |
| Type Check | ~3-4 min | Type safety (MyPy) | ✅ Yes |
| Security Audit | ~2-3 min | Vulnerability scan | ❌ No (info) |
| Test Suite | ~5-8 min | Tests + coverage (≥80%) | ✅ Yes |
| Build Verification | ~3-4 min | Production build check | ✅ Yes |
| Deployment Check | ~1 min | Final verification (main only) | ⚠️ Main only |
| Bug Logger | ~2-3 min | Auto-create issues | ⚠️ On failure |

## Quick Start for Developers

### Before Pushing Code

Run these commands locally to avoid CI failures:

```bash
# Check code quality
make lint

# Auto-format code
make format

# Verify type hints
make type-check

# Run tests with coverage
make test

# Or run all checks at once
make lint && make type-check && make test
```

### Viewing Workflow Results

1. Push changes or create PR
2. Go to GitHub → Actions → Backend CI/CD
3. Click on workflow run to see job status
4. Review job summaries for coverage and build stats
5. Download coverage artifacts if needed (7-day retention)

## Caching Strategy

### How It Works
1. **First Run**: Cache miss → Full installation (~12-15 min)
2. **Subsequent Runs**: Cache hit → Skip installation (~8-10 min)
3. **After Dependency Update**: Cache miss → Reinstall & update cache

### What Gets Cached
- **Poetry Installation**: `~/.local` (keyed by poetry.lock)
- **Virtual Environment**: `backend/.venv` (keyed by poetry.lock)
- **Speed Benefit**: ~3-5 minutes saved per run

## Coverage Reporting

### Enforcement
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% required
- **Failure**: Pipeline fails if coverage drops below threshold
- **Reports**: HTML, XML, and JSON formats generated

### Accessing Reports
- **In Workflow**: View coverage summary in job output
- **Artifacts**: Download coverage reports (7-day retention)
- **Local**: Run `make coverage` to view HTML report in browser

## Security Features

### Permissions (Least Privilege)
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read      # Read repository code
  checks: write       # Update check status
  actions: read       # Fetch job logs
  issues: write       # Create bug issues
```

### Secrets
- **Current**: No secrets required
- **Future**: Documented in `.github/workflows/.env`
- **Management**: Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

## Troubleshooting

### Lint Failures
```bash
make lint                    # See what's wrong
poetry run ruff check --fix  # Auto-fix issues
```

### Format Failures
```bash
make format  # Auto-format all code
```

### Type Check Failures
```bash
make type-check  # See specific errors
# Fix type hints or mismatches
```

### Test Failures
```bash
make test          # Run tests locally
make test-watch    # TDD mode (auto-rerun)
make coverage      # View coverage report
```

### Cache Issues
1. Go to repository → Actions → Caches
2. Delete caches for your branch
3. Re-run workflow (rebuilds cache)

## Branch Protection Setup

### Recommended Configuration for `main` Branch

1. **Settings → Branches → Add rule**

2. **Branch name pattern**: `main`

3. **Enable these rules**:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
     - Required approvals: 1
     - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed

   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
     - ✅ Require branches to be up to date
     - Required checks:
       - `Lint Check (Ruff)`
       - `Format Check (Black)`
       - `Type Check (MyPy)`
       - `Test Suite (Pytest)`
       - `Build Verification`

   - ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging

   - ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

## Performance Metrics

### Workflow Runtime
- **Cold run** (no cache): 12-15 minutes
- **Warm run** (cache hit): 8-10 minutes
- **Parallel jobs**: Quality checks run simultaneously

### Cost (GitHub Actions Minutes)
- **Public repos**: Unlimited free minutes
- **Private repos**: 2,000 free minutes/month
- **Estimated per PR**: 20-40 minutes (2-4 runs)

## Monitoring and Observability

### Workflow Status
- **GitHub UI**: Actions → Backend CI/CD
- **PR Checks**: Check status in PR page
- **Notifications**: GitHub notifications on failure

### Job Summaries
Each job adds rich summaries:
- Test coverage statistics
- Build verification results
- Security audit findings

### Artifacts
- HTML coverage report
- XML coverage report
- JSON coverage report
- **Retention**: 7 days

### Logs
- Full logs for all jobs
- **Retention**: 90 days
- Downloadable for offline analysis

## Bug Reporting (Automatic)

When CI fails:
1. **Bug logger job activates** automatically
2. **GitHub issue created** with failure details
3. **PR comment posted** with issue link
4. **Issue assigned** to PR author

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Docker Integration**
   - Build Docker images in CI
   - Container vulnerability scanning
   - Push to GitHub Container Registry

2. **Database Testing**
   - PostgreSQL service container
   - Redis service container
   - Full integration tests with real databases

3. **Deployment Automation**
   - Auto-deploy to staging on main merge
   - Manual approval for production
   - Blue-green deployment

4. **Enhanced Security**
   - SAST scanning
   - Dependency blocking on vulnerabilities
   - Secret scanning

5. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - API response time tracking
   - Database query performance
   - Memory/CPU profiling
