# 🏆 Athlete Performance App – MVP Product Owner Brief

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose
The **Athlete Performance App** empowers athletes of all levels to train like professionals — safely, effectively, and sport-specifically.
Built from a **physiotherapist’s perspective**, it bridges the gap between professional sports science and everyday athletes by combining training, injury prevention, and education.

This MVP aims to **validate demand** for a physiotherapy-led, sport-specific fitness app before expanding into AI-driven personalization, nutrition, and psychology.

## 💡 Problem & Opportunity
Most fitness apps focus on generic workouts. Athletes, however, need **sport-specific training** that considers biomechanics, injury risk, and performance goals.
Physiotherapists and coaches currently use fragmented tools — the MVP solves this with a single platform for:
✅ Evidence-based programs
✅ Injury prevention (prehab)
✅ Structured 6-week progressions

By focusing on **two initial sports (Football & Cricket)**, the MVP will test real-world adoption and gather data for future algorithmic improvements.
