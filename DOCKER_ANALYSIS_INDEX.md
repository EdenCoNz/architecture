✓ Good security practices
✗ Build-time config inflexible (address in Phase 3)

### Backend Dockerfile
✓ Well-structured
✓ Good security practices
✓ Runtime config excellent
✓ No changes needed

### Frontend CI/CD
✓ Excellent structure
✓ Good security scanning
✓ Registry publishing working
✓ Multi-arch on main branch
✗ Only unit tests (acceptable for SPA)

### Backend CI/CD
✓ Good code quality gates
✓ Integration testing excellent
✓ Functional testing comprehensive
✓ Issue automation valuable
✗ Missing Trivy scanning (CRITICAL)
✗ Missing registry publishing (CRITICAL)
✗ Single-level cache (optimize)
✗ Single-arch only (add multi-arch)

## Success Criteria

Once standardized, both applications should have:

1. **Container Security**
   - [ ] Trivy scans for vulnerabilities
   - [ ] SARIF uploaded to GitHub Security tab
   - [ ] Thresholds enforced (CRITICAL=0, HIGH<=5)

2. **Registry Management**

   - [ ] Consistent tagging strategy
   - [ ] Multi-arch on main branch
   - [ ] Clear image versioning

3. **Configuration Management**
   - [ ] Same image for multiple environments
   - [ ] Runtime configuration only
   - [ ] Environment-specific secrets via CI/CD

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Code quality gates (lint, format, type)
   - [ ] Unit + Integration tests
   - [ ] Container functional tests
   - [ ] Security scanning (dependencies + image)
   - [ ] Coverage thresholds enforced

5. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Docker best practices guide
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline documentation
   - [ ] Deployment procedures
   - [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Why doesn't backend publish to registry?**
   - Is this intentional?
   - How are containers deployed to production?

2. **What's the production deployment process?**
   - Docker Compose?
   - Kubernetes?
   - Other orchestration?

3. **Should all apps have same configuration approach?**
   - Build-time (simpler but inflexible)
   - Runtime (complex but flexible)
   - Hybrid (best of both)?

4. **What's the multi-environment strategy?**
   - dev, staging, production
   - How many environments?
   - How is configuration managed?

5. **What are the deployment constraints?**
   - Hardware/architecture limitations?
   - Performance requirements?
   - Security requirements?
