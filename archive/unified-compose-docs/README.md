# Archived: Unified Compose Documentation

**Archived Date:** 2025-10-27
**Archived By:** Feature #15, Story 15.4
**Reason:** Experimental approach superseded by canonical docker-compose.yml

---

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for an experimental "unified compose" approach that was evaluated during Feature #15 (Phase 1: Consolidate Docker Compose Files).

**Outcome:** The experiment determined that the standard Docker Compose overlay pattern (docker-compose.yml + environment-specific overlay files) is superior to the unified single-file approach.

## Archived Files

### DOCKER_COMPOSE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
- **Purpose:** Migration guide for transitioning from multi-file to unified single-file approach
- **Status:** Superseded
- **Replacement:** Use `docs/configuration.md` for current Docker Compose usage

### DOCKER_COMPOSE_UNIFIED_SUMMARY.md
- **Purpose:** Implementation summary for unified compose architecture
- **Status:** Superseded
- **Replacement:** See Story 15.2 comparison analysis in `docs/features/15/compose-file-comparison.md`

---

## Why This Approach Was Abandoned

From Story 15.2 analysis (docs/features/15/compose-file-comparison.md):

**docker-compose.yml (Canonical - Kept):**
- Production-proven (Feature #12 implementation)
- Uses standard Docker Compose overlay pattern
- Secure by default (no exposed ports in base file)
- Feature-complete (100% vs 75%)
- Less complex (31 env vars vs 84+)
- Comprehensive documentation and helper scripts

**docker-compose.unified.yml (Experimental - Removed):**
- Never tested in production
- Non-standard single-file pattern
- Required 84+ environment variables
- Missing critical features (env_file directive, bind mounts)
- Complex conditional logic
- Incomplete (75% feature coverage)

**Decision:** Keep docker-compose.yml as canonical file, remove docker-compose.unified.yml

---

## Current Docker Compose Architecture

**Pattern:** Standard overlay pattern (Docker Compose best practice)

```
docker-compose.yml              # Base configuration (all services)
compose.override.yml            # Local development overrides (automatic)
compose.staging.yml             # Staging environment overrides
compose.production.yml          # Production environment overrides
compose.test.yml                # Test environment configuration
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Local development (uses override automatically)
docker compose up -d

# Staging
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f compose.staging.yml up -d

# Production
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f compose.production.yml up -d

# Test
docker compose -f compose.test.yml up -d
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Standard patterns win:** Docker Compose overlay pattern is well-understood and supported
2. **Production validation matters:** Untested approaches should not replace proven configurations
3. **Simplicity over cleverness:** 31 environment variables beats 84+ with complex conditionals
4. **Feature completeness critical:** 100% features > 75% features with simpler approach
5. **Documentation and tooling:** Helper scripts and validation tools indicate maturity

## For Historical Reference

These files document a valid technical approach that was explored but not adopted. They remain archived for:

- Understanding the decision-making process
- Reference for future evaluations of similar patterns
- Learning from the comparison analysis
- Historical record of Feature #15 Phase 1 implementation

---

**Current Status:** Phase 1 (Story 15.4) Complete
**Next Steps:**
- Story 15.5: Remove backend compose files
- Story 15.6: Remove frontend compose files
- Story 15.7: Validate consolidated configuration
- Story 15.8: Verify service functionality
- Story 15.9: Update documentation
- Story 15.10: Communicate changes
