# Required Secrets
# ============================================================================

# TARGET_REPO_PAT
# ---------------
# Purpose: Authenticate and push to EdenCoNz/proform repository
# Used by: .github/workflows/sync-to-proform.yml
#
# How to create:
#   1. GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens
#   2. Generate new token with:
#      - Repository access: Only EdenCoNz/proform
#      - Permissions: Contents (Read and write)
#   3. Add to repository: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
#      - Name: TARGET_REPO_PAT
#      - Value: <paste token>
#
# Recommended: Set 90-day expiration and create calendar reminder to rotate

# Frontend CI/CD (frontend-ci.yml)
# ============================================================================

# Current Status: No secrets required for current operations
#
# The frontend CI/CD workflow currently runs without any secrets for:
# - ESLint linting checks
# - Prettier formatting checks
# - TypeScript type checking
# - Production builds
# - Build artifact generation and upload
# - Security audit (npm audit)
# - Docker image building and testing (local only, no push to registry)
# - Bug logging to JSON file (uses default GITHUB_TOKEN)
#
# Docker Build Job:
# The workflow builds Docker images and tests them locally without pushing to
# any container registry. This means no registry credentials are needed.
# Images are tagged with:
#   - frontend:${GITHUB_SHA} (commit-specific tag)
#   - frontend:latest (latest tag)
#
# The Docker job:
# - Builds image using docker/build-push-action with push: false
# - Tests health endpoint (http://localhost:8080/health)
# - Verifies application serves HTML correctly
# - Uses GitHub Actions cache (type=gha) for faster builds
#
# Bug Logging Job (log-bugs):
# This job runs automatically when any CI job fails on feature branches:
# - Extracts feature ID from branch name (format: feature/{id})
# - Creates bug log entry using docs/templates/bug-log-template.md
# - Automatically creates GitHub issue with bug details and full logs
# - Posts PR comment with link to created issue
# - Requires permissions: contents: read, issues: write, actions: read
#
# The log-bugs job uses the default GITHUB_TOKEN which is automatically provided
# by GitHub Actions with appropriate permissions based on the workflow configuration.
# No additional secrets are required.
#
# GitHub Issue Creation:
# - Issues are created automatically when CI/CD jobs fail
# - Issue is assigned to the PR author
# - Issue title format: [branch-name] failure description
# - Issue body includes: failure details, log excerpts, links, and full bug log template
#
# Future Secrets (when implementing container registry push):
# - DOCKER_USERNAME: Docker Hub username or registry username
# - DOCKER_TOKEN: Docker Hub access token or registry password
# - GHCR_TOKEN: GitHub Container Registry token (or use GITHUB_TOKEN with packages: write)
#
# Future Secrets (when implementing cloud deployment):
# - Cloud provider credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, etc.)
# - Deployment API tokens (NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN, VERCEL_TOKEN, etc.)
# - Environment-specific configuration secrets
# - Kubernetes credentials (KUBECONFIG, KUBE_TOKEN, etc.)

# Backend CI/CD (backend-ci.yml)
# ============================================================================

# Current Status: No secrets required for current operations
#
# The backend CI/CD workflow currently runs without any secrets for:
# - Ruff linting checks
# - Black code formatting validation
# - MyPy type checking
# - Pytest test suite with coverage reporting
# - Security audit (Poetry + Safety)
# - Build verification (Poetry build + Django checks)
# - Bug logging and GitHub issue creation (uses default GITHUB_TOKEN)
#
# All jobs use Poetry for dependency management with intelligent caching:
# - Poetry installation cached at ~/.local
# - Virtual environment cached at backend/.venv
# - Cache keys based on poetry.lock hash for automatic invalidation
#
# Test Coverage:
# The workflow enforces an 80% minimum coverage threshold and generates:
# - HTML coverage report (htmlcov/)
# - XML coverage report (coverage.xml)
# - JSON coverage report (coverage.json)
# Reports are uploaded as artifacts with 7-day retention.
#
# Build Verification:
# The build job verifies production readiness by:
# - Building Python package with Poetry
# - Running Django deployment checks (manage.py check --deploy)
# - Collecting static files for production
# Uses temporary environment variables for CI build verification.
#
# Bug Logging Job (log-bugs):
# This job runs automatically when any CI job fails:
# - Extracts feature ID from branch name (format: feature/{id})
# - Creates bug log entry using docs/templates/bug-log-template.md
# - Automatically creates GitHub issue with bug details and full logs
# - Posts PR comment with link to created issue
# - Requires permissions: contents: read, issues: write, actions: read
#
# The log-bugs job uses the default GITHUB_TOKEN which is automatically provided
# by GitHub Actions with appropriate permissions based on the workflow configuration.
# No additional secrets are required.
#
# Security Scanning:
# - Poetry security audit (poetry show --tree)
# - Safety vulnerability scanner (safety check)
# Results are informational and don't block builds by default.
#
# Future Secrets (when implementing database testing):
# - DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string for integration tests
# - REDIS_URL: Redis connection string for caching tests
# - Test database credentials
#
# Future Secrets (when implementing Docker deployment):
# - DOCKER_USERNAME: Docker Hub username or registry username
# - DOCKER_TOKEN: Docker Hub access token or registry password
# - GHCR_TOKEN: GitHub Container Registry token (or use GITHUB_TOKEN with packages: write)
#
# Future Secrets (when implementing cloud deployment):
# - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: Production Django secret key
# - Cloud provider credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, etc.)
# - DATABASE_URL: Production database connection string
# - REDIS_URL: Production Redis connection string
# - Email service credentials (SENDGRID_API_KEY, AWS_SES_*, etc.)
# - Object storage credentials (S3_ACCESS_KEY, S3_SECRET_KEY, etc.)
# - Application monitoring (SENTRY_DSN, NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY, etc.)
# - Kubernetes credentials (KUBECONFIG, KUBE_TOKEN, etc.)
