# Dynamic Job Mapping Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive solution implemented to prevent job ID/name mismatch issues and ensure explicit failures when job matching fails in the bug-logger workflow.

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**YAML Validation:** ✅ All files validated

---

## Problem Statement

### Original Issue

The bug-logger workflow used a hardcoded mapping between job IDs and job names:

```bash
declare -A JOB_ID_TO_NAME_MAP=(
  ["lint"]="Lint Check (Ruff)"
  ["format"]="Format Check (Black)"
  ...
)
```

**Critical Problems:**

1. **Synchronization Issues:** When job names changed in workflow files, the hardcoded mapping became stale
2. **Silent Failures:** Fallback logic using job ID as name caused incomplete bug reports
3. **Maintenance Burden:** Every job addition/rename required updating multiple files
4. **No Validation:** No automated checks to catch mismatches before deployment

### Example Failure

```
Job ID in workflow: "lint"
Job name in workflow: "Lint Check (Ruff)"
Hardcoded mapping: "lint" → "Lint Check"  ← OUTDATED!
Result: Job matching failed, bug report incomplete
```

---

## Solution Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth:** Workflow files are the authoritative source for job mappings
2. **Dynamic Extraction:** Extract mappings at runtime using `yq` YAML parser
3. **Fail-Fast Error Handling:** Explicit failures with detailed error messages, never silent fallbacks
4. **Automated Validation:** PR checks enforce naming conventions before merge

### Implementation Components

#### 1. Dynamic Job Mapping (bug-logger.yml)

**Location:** `.github/workflows/bug-logger.yml`

**Implementation:**

```bash
# Step 1: Detect source workflow
WORKFLOW_NAME=$(gh run view $RUN_ID --json workflowName --jq '.workflowName')

case "$WORKFLOW_NAME" in
  "Backend CI/CD") WORKFLOW_FILE=".github/workflows/backend-ci.yml" ;;
  "Frontend CI/CD") WORKFLOW_FILE=".github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml" ;;
  *)
    echo "::error::FATAL: Unknown workflow name: '$WORKFLOW_NAME'"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

# Step 2: Extract job mappings dynamically
yq eval '.jobs | to_entries | .[] | .key + "=" + .value.name' "$WORKFLOW_FILE" > job_mapping.txt

# Step 3: Build lookup table
declare -A JOB_ID_TO_NAME_MAP
while IFS='=' read -r JOB_ID JOB_NAME; do
  JOB_ID_TO_NAME_MAP[$JOB_ID]="$JOB_NAME"
done < job_mapping.txt

# Step 4: Look up job name with explicit failure
FAILED_JOB_NAME="${JOB_ID_TO_NAME_MAP[$FAILED_JOB_ID]}"

if [ -z "$FAILED_JOB_NAME" ] || [ "$FAILED_JOB_NAME" = "null" ]; then
  echo "::error::FATAL: Could not find job name for failed job ID '$FAILED_JOB_ID'"
  echo "Available job mappings:"
  cat job_mapping.txt | sed 's/^/  /'
  exit 1
fi
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero maintenance for job additions/renames
- Impossible for mappings to get out of sync
- Clear error messages when jobs can't be found
- Self-documenting through inline comments

---

#### 2. Validation Workflow (validate-job-mappings.yml)

**Location:** `.github/workflows/validate-job-mappings.yml`

**Purpose:** Prevent job naming issues from being merged

**Triggers:**
- Pull requests modifying CI/CD workflow files
- Pushes to main branch
- Manual dispatch

**Validation Checks:**

1. **Missing Name Fields:**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ FAIL: Missing name field
   jobs:
     lint:
       runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

   # ✅ PASS: Has name field
   jobs:
     lint:
       name: Lint Check (Ruff)
       runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
   ```

2. **Duplicate Job Names:**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ WARNING: Duplicate names
   jobs:
     lint-backend:
       name: Lint Check
     lint-frontend:
       name: Lint Check  # Duplicate!
   ```

3. **Empty or Null Names:**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ FAIL: Empty name
   jobs:
     lint:
       name: ""
       runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
   ```

**Failure Mode:**
- PR check fails
- Automated comment posted to PR with:
  - List of problematic jobs
  - Clear instructions on how to fix
  - Link to DEVOPS_GUIDELINES.md
- PR cannot be merged until fixed

## Error Handling Implementation

### Fail-Fast Philosophy

Every critical path validates inputs and fails explicitly:

```bash
# Example: Workflow file validation
if [ ! -f "$WORKFLOW_FILE" ]; then
  echo "::error::FATAL: Workflow file not found: $WORKFLOW_FILE"
  echo ""
  echo "This error indicates:"
  echo "  1. Workflow file was moved or deleted"
  echo "  2. Repository structure changed"
  echo "  3. File path mapping is incorrect"
  echo ""
  echo "Expected location: $WORKFLOW_FILE"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Error Message Format

All error messages follow this structure:

1. **What Failed:** Clear description of the error
2. **Why It Failed:** List of possible root causes
3. **How to Debug:** Step-by-step debugging instructions
4. **Context:** Relevant data (available jobs, expected values)

### Example Error Message

```
::error::FATAL: Could not find job name for failed job ID 'lint'

This indicates one of the following issues:
  1. Job ID 'lint' does not exist in .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml
  2. Job ID mismatch between workflow file and job_results
  3. Dynamic extraction failed to capture this job

Available job mappings in .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml:
  format=Format Check (Black)
  type-check=Type Check (MyPy)
  test=Test Suite (Pytest)

Failed job ID from job_results: lint

Debugging steps:
  1. Verify job 'lint' exists in .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml
  2. Check job has 'name:' field defined and is not empty
  3. Ensure job ID matches YAML key exactly (case-sensitive)
  4. Review .github/DEVOPS_GUIDELINES.md for troubleshooting
```

---

## Validation Results

### YAML Syntax Validation

All workflow files validated successfully:

```
✓ .github/workflows/bug-logger.yml - Valid
✓ .github/workflows/validate-job-mappings.yml - Valid
✓ .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml - Valid
✓ .github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml - Valid
```

### Job Name Validation

Current status of all CI/CD workflows:

**Backend CI (.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml):**
- ✅ All 7 jobs have explicit `name:` fields
- ✅ No duplicate names
- ✅ All names are descriptive

**Frontend CI (.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml):**
- ✅ All 6 jobs have explicit `name:` fields
- ✅ No duplicate names
- ✅ All names are descriptive

---

## Benefits of This Solution

### 1. Zero Maintenance

**Before:**
```yaml
# In backend-ci.yml
jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint Check (New Tool)  # Changed!

# In bug-logger.yml
declare -A JOB_ID_TO_NAME_MAP=(
  ["lint"]="Lint Check (Ruff)"  # ← STALE! Must update manually
)
```

**After:**
```yaml
# In backend-ci.yml
jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint Check (New Tool)  # Changed!

# In bug-logger.yml
# No changes needed - extracts dynamically!
yq eval '.jobs.lint.name' backend-ci.yml
# Result: "Lint Check (New Tool)" ✓
```

### 2. Impossible to Get Out of Sync

- Workflow file is single source of truth
- Mapping extracted at runtime
- Always reflects current state

### 3. Explicit Failures Prevent Silent Bugs

**Before:**
```bash
# Silent fallback
if [ -z "$FAILED_JOB_NAME" ]; then
  FAILED_JOB_NAME="$FAILED_JOB_ID"  # Uses wrong name!
fi
# Result: Incomplete bug report, hard to debug
```

**After:**
```bash
# Explicit failure
if [ -z "$FAILED_JOB_NAME" ]; then
  echo "::error::FATAL: Could not find job name"
  exit 1  # Fails immediately with detailed error
fi
# Result: Clear error message, easy to fix
```

### 4. Automated Prevention

- PR validation catches issues before merge
- Developers get immediate feedback
- Impossible to merge problematic workflows

### 5. Self-Documenting Code

- Inline comments explain every step
- Error messages reference troubleshooting guides
- Documentation co-located with code

---

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Job to Backend CI

**Step 1:** Add job to backend-ci.yml

```yaml
jobs:
  security-scan:
    name: Security Scan (Trivy)  # ← Required!
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Run Trivy scan
        run: trivy scan .
```

**Step 2:** That's it!

- Dynamic extraction automatically picks up new job
- No changes needed to bug-logger.yml
- Validation workflow checks for name field
- PR can be merged if validation passes

### Renaming a Job

**Step 1:** Update name field in workflow file

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint Check (Ruff v2)  # ← Changed name
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
```

**Step 2:** That's it!

- Dynamic extraction uses new name immediately
- No hardcoded mappings to update
- Bug reports automatically use new name

### Adding a New CI/CD Workflow

**Step 1:** Create workflow file with named jobs

```yaml
# .github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml
name: Mobile CI/CD

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Android App
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
```

**Step 2:** Register workflow in bug-logger.yml

```bash
case "$WORKFLOW_NAME" in
  "Backend CI/CD") WORKFLOW_FILE=".github/workflows/backend-ci.yml" ;;
  "Frontend CI/CD") WORKFLOW_FILE=".github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml" ;;
  "Mobile CI/CD") WORKFLOW_FILE=".github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml" ;;  # ← Add
  ...
esac
```

**Step 3:** That's it!

- Dynamic extraction works for new workflow
- All job names extracted automatically
- Validation workflow can be extended to cover new file

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Continuous Monitoring

1. **Watch for ::error:: in logs:**
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=bug-logger.yml --status=failure
   gh run view <run-id> --log | grep "::error::"
   ```

2. **Review validation failures:**
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=validate-job-mappings.yml --status=failure
   ```

3. **Check issue quality:**
   - Verify bug reports have correct job names
   - Ensure log excerpts are complete
   - Confirm all metadata is populated

### Maintenance Schedule

**Weekly:**
- Review bug-logger execution times
- Check for any error patterns

**Monthly:**
- Review and update DEVOPS_GUIDELINES.md
- Check for new CI/CD workflows that need registration

**Quarterly:**
- Run full test suite
- Update yq version if needed
- Review error message effectiveness

### Metrics to Track

1. **Bug Logger Success Rate:**
   - Target: 100% (with explicit failures, not silent bugs)

2. **Validation Catch Rate:**
   - Track how many PRs are caught by validation
   - Measure time to fix validation failures

3. **Job Matching Accuracy:**
   - Verify all failed jobs are matched correctly
   - Track any mismatches (should be zero)

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:

### Immediate Rollback

```bash
# Revert all changes
git revert <commit-sha-1> <commit-sha-2> <commit-sha-3>
git push origin HEAD:main
```

### Partial Rollback (Keep Validation)

If dynamic extraction has issues but validation is working:

1. Keep validate-job-mappings.yml active
2. Temporarily restore hardcoded mapping in bug-logger.yml
3. Fix dynamic extraction issues
4. Re-deploy when ready

### Emergency Fix

If validation workflow is blocking critical PRs:

```bash
# Temporarily disable validation
mv .github/workflows/validate-job-mappings.yml \
   .github/workflows/validate-job-mappings.yml.disabled

# Create issue to track re-enablement
gh issue create --title "Re-enable job mapping validation" \
  --label bug --assignee @me
```
